Princeton football falls in nail-biter to Yale 13-10 on senior day,"Top Stories, Sports, top-story, Football, homepage, m-sports, sports-recaps",Jordan Halagao,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:55:35 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-football-falls-nail-biter-yale-senior-day-november-2025,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-football-falls-nail-biter-yale-senior-day-november-2025,"In the final home game of the season, Princeton Football (3-6 overall, 2-4 Ivy League) fell short to the Yale Bulldogs (7-2, 5-1) in yet another close loss for the Tigers. In this low-scoring, gritty showdown, the Princeton defense kept the team within striking distance, shutting down a Yale offense that had been averaging 29.8 points per game before Saturday. However, the team could not muster enough offensive firepower to overcome the Bulldogs and their aggressive pass rush. Before kickoff, the team's seniors walked out of the tunnel arm in arm with families and loved ones for Senior Day to be honored for their contributions to the program. ""You never think it's going to come until it does,"" senior linebacker Marco Scarano said as he reflected on the last time playing at Powers Field. ""I couldn't be more grateful. I love this place and this program."" On the field, Scarano had a stellar performance, with nine total tackles. One would not have known that he had been battling an illness throughout the week. ""I didn't know until game time if he was going to play,"" Head Coach Bob Surace '90 said. ""I talked to him, and he's like, 'I'm not missing the game.'"" On Princeton's opening possession, senior quarterback Kai Colón was sacked twice in a row to end the drive, an early sign of how Yale's pass pressure would affect the game. Yale went on to sack Colón six times in total, which is tied for the most Princeton has allowed this season. On the ensuing drive, Yale was knocking on the door in the Princeton red zone. A pass to the end zone went off the hands of a Yale receiver before junior defensive back Torian Roberts tipped it into the air. While on the ground, Roberts tracked the ball and came up with the interception. Princeton 0, Yale 0 | 4:47 1st RING THE BELL @TorianRoberts1 ! He tips the pass to himself and gets the pick! 📺- @NBCSPhilly , @SNYtv 💻 - https://t.co/IdGRM7mYdM 📻 - https://t.co/2OrfnwGgOV 📊 - https://t.co/4CRpxJtNnA #JUICE 🍊🥤 pic.twitter.com/Vf6tYBIEF6 - Princeton Football (@PrincetonFTBL) November 15, 2025 ""All week, our focus has been disguise, disguise, disguise,"" Roberts said. ""We just gave the quarterback a different look, and I was able to read the ball. Once I tipped it … my initial instinct was to find the ball and come down with it."" On a third-and-nine after the interception, Yale brought heavy pressure. Colón stood in the pocket and delivered a 28-yard completion, taking a late hit in the process. A roughing the passer call tacked on an additional 15 yards to the end of the play. Though Princeton drove into Yale's red zone, they wound up settling for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead. As Yale breached Princeton territory on their next drive, Roberts rang the turnover bell a second time. He disguised the coverage look again before nabbing another interception to stop the potential Yale scoring drive. Princeton then went three-and-out, punting the ball back to Yale, who evened the score at 3-3 with a field goal. After another Princeton punt, the Bulldogs followed it up with a one-yard rushing touchdown to go up 10-3. Looking to get some points before the end of the half, Princeton made its way to the Yale ten-yard line. With 12 seconds on the clock and no timeouts, Princeton tried to take one last shot at the endzone. However, Yale again sacked Colón, causing time to run out. The Tigers lost out on a potential three points, which would come back to haunt the team. Despite their offensive struggles, the team was just down by one score going into the second half. In an effort to find a solution to Yale's pass rush, Princeton used a variety of quick screens and balls over the middle instead of taking shots down the field. In the first drive of the third quarter, the Tigers again made it within Yale's 20-yard line. Fighting for extra yardage, senior running back Dareion Murphy lost the ball, and Yale came away with it to leave the Tigers empty-handed on their second consecutive trip to the red zone. Throughout much of the second half, the physical Tiger defense continually stopped the now-stagnant Yale offense, holding them to zero points and forcing three punts in the third quarter. It was not until early in the fourth quarter that the Tigers found new life. First-year receiver Josh Robinson took a short screen pass 48 yards to the Yale 12-yard line, and Clark scored a one-yard touchdown rush to square the game at 10-10. In response, Yale finally broke through Princeton's steadfast second-half defense on the ensuing drive, settling with a field goal to go up 13-10. But with three minutes and fifty seconds left, the game was not over yet, and the Tigers made it across midfield with over a minute to go. However, Yale's pressure went to Colón yet again. After dropping back, he was hit as he threw, leading to an inaccurate pass that was picked off by Yale to ice the game. The loss to Yale is the Tigers' fourth in as many weeks. It also marks the third game in a row in which Princeton fell short by exactly three points. ""They left it all on the field,"" Surace said. ""It's painful when you play these even games a few weeks in a row. We just got to get those little details done a little better."" Despite a near month of struggles, the players still see a potential light at the end of the tunnel. A win on the road against rival Penn could partially help close the season on a high note. ""We have one more opportunity to send the seniors off the right way, and that's what we're going to do,"" Roberts said. Princeton football will play its final game of the season at Penn, just an hour's drive away, this coming Saturday at 1 p.m. Jordan Halagao is a Sports contributor for the 'Prince.'

Second annual TigerTies event draws over 600 students and community members,"Top Stories, news, top-story, student-life, homepage",Sena Chang,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:51:01 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-stlife-second-annual-tiger-ties-event-draws-over-600-students,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-stlife-second-annual-tiger-ties-event-draws-over-600-students,"Now in its second year, the Undergraduate Student Government's (USG) TigerTies event held on Saturday brought together more than 600 students and community members and 30 student groups and performances, highlighting international and cross-cultural connections on campus. As the kickoff event to the Davis International Center's International Education Week, the night featured student booths, a cultural fashion show, and food from various local vendors. ""Last year was our first time ever launching this event, and I think it was still something that people were getting introduced to,"" said Karen Villanueva '27, the executive secretary of the USG and the co-organizer of TigerTies. ""Now that people understand what the mission of the event is and how it's run, we've seen a lot more participation and engagement."" Last year, over 500 students attended the event, with a similar number of student group booths and performances. On Saturday, students remarked on the diverse selection of food and activities, as well as how the event brought cultural groups together. Eleni Staikos '27, who tabled the Orange Panhellenic Association's booth, described TigerTies as ""a way to bring the community together."" ""Everybody has been coming around and asking questions … it's actually been really exciting, and I didn't expect it,"" Staikos told the 'Prince.' ""It was really nice to see all these groups come together - it's really rare to have that happen,"" said Ruoming Shen '27, a co-president of the Asian-American Students Association (AASA). ""There's so many fun activities, and it's really cool to see what each cultural group brings,"" Stephanie Ma '27, a co-president of the AASA, added. This year's event introduced a cultural fashion show in which participants showcased traditional clothing from their countries of origin. ""It was to show people where they came from, and that was a very nice aspect [of TigerTies],"" said Jeremy Bao '27, USG's projects manager and a co-organizer of the event. Villanueva expressed hopes to expand the reach of TigerTies to the broader graduate student and town community. ""In the future, it is a big goal of ours to have it become even more open to people from all over the community,"" Villanueva said. ""I really hope this becomes something that we can have happen every year,"" she continued. TigerTies was sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (ODUS), the Davis International Center, and the Carl A. Fields Center. The event officially kicked off International Education Week, which runs from Nov. 17 to Nov. 21. Sena Chang is a senior News writer and Features contributor for the 'Prince.'

USG celebrates 50th anniversary with former student leaders,"Top Stories, news, top-story, USG, homepage",Oliver Wu,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:45:36 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-usg-celebrates-50-years-former-student-leaders,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-usg-celebrates-50-years-former-student-leaders,"Students, alumni, and administrators gathered at Prospect House on Saturday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Undergraduate Student Government (USG). Over 60 total attendees participated, including around a dozen former student government leaders. The event began with a short opening address by USG president Enzo Kho '26, who reflected on the group's history. ""Tonight is not just a celebration of an organization,"" Kho said. ""It's a celebration of the countless people who have shaped Princeton through service."" ""I think of all the students who will stand here in 2075, celebrating the 100th year anniversary of USG,"" he continued. ""I hope they look back on this moment and see a USG that showed courage over comfort, partnership over politics, and service above self."" Tom Pyle '76, the first USG president, delivered the keynote address. ""I have a distinct honor, I suppose, to be your George Washington of the USG,"" he said. He then read from a 13-page paper he had prepared for the event, noting he wrote it in the style of a junior paper ""to show you younger people that we still got it."" The paper, titled ""Energized, Enervated, Elevated: A Student Politico's USG Journey (As He Experienced It 50 Years Ago),"" draws from Pyle's diary and recounts his tumultuous time leading the newly formed USG. Pyle originally ran for Undergraduate Assembly (UGA) president, the governing body that existed before USG. When UGA was deemed inadequate at addressing student concerns, the University transitioned to the USG model. Pyle shifted strategy, and his slate of candidates were all elected in the first USG election. However, Pyle soon encountered challenges. Citing archived issues of the 'Prince,' he recounted how a personal conflict with the Academics Committee chair led to an attempt to recall him . In the original USG constitution, only 500 student signatures were needed to remove any USG officer. Pyle's rival successfully met the threshold of signatures, and he was recalled . However, in the ensuing snap election, Pyle ran again and won , regaining his position. Because of his USG responsibilities and political advocacy, Pyle said he spent less time on his senior thesis than he would've liked, earning him a B. He described a similar time crunch while preparing for the event. ""I finished it about 11 today - just in time,"" Pyle told the 'Prince.' An alumni panel followed Pyle's speech, moderated by alumni engagement chair Elisa Gonzalez '27. The panel consisted of former USG presidents Manuel Gonzalez '85, Zarnab Virk '20, and Dave Calone '96; former USG secretary-treasurer Christina Tan '92; and former UGA president Andy Strenio '74. Several panelists led USG during periods of significant campus transition. ""We had the Vietnam War going on, and, at that time, all of the males in the student body were liable to draft,"" Strenio said. ""We also had the energy crisis that year. … The campus was shut down between the Christmas break and exams."" Strenio spoke about the culture of student advocacy that was widespread during his term in an interview with the 'Prince.' He encountered challenges with how to approach controversial speakers. ""We didn't think it was right to deprive audience members of being able to listen to what the speaker had to say,"" Strenio said. ""People that wanted to protest were welcome to go sit … They would simply stand silently and turn their back to the speaker."" Calone - the first person to serve two terms as USG president - navigated the early years of the internet on campus. ""By the end of my second term, email just rolled out across the campus, and I was actually given the right to email all the students,"" he said. Amy Park '27, the current USGChief of Staff, and Angeline Yan '28, the Deputy Chief of Staff, led the planning for the event. ""We only thought maybe four or five would come,"" Park said of the alumni. ""But almost 15 alumni came. I think it was really, really great."" Oliver Wu is a News contributor for the 'Prince.'

"New policy barring most recording set to take effect Jan. 1, other details remain unclear","Top Stories, news, top-story, u-affairs, homepage, CPUC",Nikoloz Inashvili,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:45:18 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-university-recording-policy-set-take-effect-jan-1-2026,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-university-recording-policy-set-take-effect-jan-1-2026,"Princeton's sweeping new policy passed Nov. 10 that would ban recordings in most settings without the consent of all participants will not take effect until Jan. 1, University spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss said in a statement. However, there is still limited information about how the policy will be implemented, particularly regarding its enforcement and the scope of recording permissions. Hotchkiss wrote that ""The University is preparing guidance on the implementation of this policy, which will be made available well ahead of the Jan. 1, 2026 implementation."" The policy bars recording in ""any place where the individual or group involved has a reasonable expectation of being free from unwanted surveillance, eavesdropping, recording or observation without the knowledge and consent of all participants subject to such recordings,"" encompassing educational, residential, research and workplace settings, including off-campus University sponsored activities. It also applies to the recording of ""meetings or events that might otherwise be construed as public or open when it has been explicitly stated that recording is not permitted."" There are limited exceptions for situations such as disability accommodations. The policy was first raised and passed at the Nov. 10 Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) meeting. Though there were no votes in opposition, Genevieve Shutt '26 - a member of CPUC and a USG U-Councilor - abstained from voting. ""Our campus will only become more insular and bureaucratic, and the majority of our campus will be excluded from important conversations and placing an undue burden on student journalists,"" Shutt wrote to the 'Prince' after the meeting. ""The University's new recording policy will be implemented with an eye to maintaining existing media access and to supporting media accuracy,"" Hotchkiss wrote. The policy has not yet been formally disseminated by the University, and several students who spoke with the 'Prince' had little knowledge of the policy or its implications. ""I would like to think that the University is making choices in the best interest of students,"" said Ify Obianwu '27, although she acknowledged she understood how the policy ""could be problematic."" ""I don't know how it's going to affect people personally,"" she added. ""There is a need to protect students' privacy on our campus, especially during a period of uncertainty, and the increased surveillance of international and undocumented students in higher education warrants a recording conversation on our campus,"" Shutt added. Grace Opong '27 shared similar concerns about the unclear aspects of the new recording policy. Though she has heard about the policy, she said she was not aware of any details about what the policy entails or how it was developed. It remains unclear how the University will enforce the policy, which also bars the distribution and transmission of such recordings, or when the future FAQ page will be published.

University fundraising database left compromised after cybersecurity incident,"Top Stories, news, top-story, u-affairs, homepage",Haeon Lee,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:42:08 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-university-data-compromised-after-cybersecurity-incident,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-university-data-compromised-after-cybersecurity-incident,"A University Advancement database containing information about alumni, donors, students, parents, some faculty, and other members of the University community was compromised on Nov. 10, putting their data at risk of access by outside actors. According to a Saturday announcement from the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the breach occurred after outside actors targeted a University employee with access to the database through a phone-based phishing attempt. The incident began on Nov. 10 and was blocked within 24 hours. The database compromised included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and home and business addresses, along with information about University fundraising and donations. It ""generally"" did not include sensitive information like Social Security numbers, passwords, or credit card and bank account numbers. ""[W]e moved as quickly as possible to notify those potentially affected so they can be vigilant for potential phishing attempts,"" University spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss wrote in an email to The Daily Princetonian. Hotchkiss added that ""the University, in consultation with outside experts, has worked continuously to understand the incident."" OIT noted in an FAQ page posted after the breach that the investigation is ongoing and may take several weeks. No suspects have been identified in OIT's investigation, and officials have not yet determined precisely what information was accessed. OITnotified law enforcement of the incident. The notification of the breach comes immediately after a widespread disruption that impacted printing and single sign-on, and other OIT resources beginning Friday. About 51 percent of ""affected servers and related infrastructure"" have been restored as of 5 p.m. on Sunday. Hotchkiss wrote that the service outage was unrelated to the service database. A much larger-scale attack hit the University of Pennsylvania on Oct. 31. Individuals claiming responsibility released thousands of internal documents online, including donor records, confidential University memos, and personal identifying information for Penn students, alumni, and donors. The group claimed it had accessed data for 1.2 million users, although Penn disputes that claim. The Penn hackers gained full access to a Penn employee's account and posted samples of the data on LeakForum after sending mass spam emails to the Penn community. Penn reported the breach to the FBI, and the group has threatened to release or sell additional data. OIT said they had no information indicating Princeton's breach was related to that at Penn or ""any other incident."" As the investigation continues, Hotchkiss urged all community members to practice ""good digital hygiene"" by lengthening and regularly updating passwords for online accounts. Chief Information Officer Daren Hubbard and Vice President for Advancement Kevin Heaney both warned the University community to ""be alert for unusual messages that purport to come from the University. No one from Princeton University should ever call, text, or email you asking for sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, passwords, or bank information."" ""We continue to monitor and improve our security efforts, reinforcing our already robust cybersecurity measures, including continuing to enhance training for all users,"" Hotchkiss wrote.

Women's hockey defeats Providence in two-game nonconference series,"Top Stories, Sports, top-story, Women&#039;s Hockey, homepage, w-sports, sports-recaps",Isa Mena,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:41:10 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-womens-hockey-defeats-providence-twice-november-2025,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-womens-hockey-defeats-providence-twice-november-2025,"Princeton women's hockey (6-4-0 overall, 4-2-0 ECAC) defeated the Providence College Friars (4-9-1, 2-3-1) in a two-game non-conference series at Baker Rink this past weekend. Princeton began the series with a 3-0 shutout victory and continued the momentum the next day with a 3-1 win. The Tigers started out strong in the first period, outshooting the Friars and seizing the puck at every opportunity. Princeton maintained a persistent offensive front while successfully defending counter attacks from Providence. Two minutes into the game, Providence had two close shots on goal, both of which were saved by first-year goaltender Lia Nevo. The Tigers quickly launched a counter attack; sophomore defender Brooklyn Nimegeers drove up the rink and took a shot but could not find the net. Just over halfway through the first period, a faceoff between first-year center forward Riley Sorokan and two Providence players took place in front of the Friars' goal. Senior captain and forward Issy Wunder snuck in and stole the puck from the Friars, taking a shot and placing it in the back of the net, putting the Tigers in the lead 1-0. But the Friars did not let up easily. Putting up a fight from the start, Providence played aggressively and tactically intercepted plays, creating several scoring opportunities. For Princeton, it was winning faceoffs and creating turnovers that made all the difference. ""When you're in 50-50 battles, it's a hit or be hit mentality,"" junior forward Ani Kozak told The Daily Princetonian after the game. ""So we're gonna be puck first, and we're gonna win those battles."" With the clock ticking down in the first period, Kozak stole the puck around the half line and drove up the rink to Providence's goal. She hurled a shot and scored a top shelf goal, setting the Tigers ahead by two. Tension rose in a scoreless second period as the Friars attempted to get themselves on the scoreboard. But the Tigers stayed consistent and made good transitions, maintaining their lead. ""We have to play 60 minutes with good habits and details,"" women's hockey Head Coach Courtney Birchard-Kessel told the 'Prince' after the game. ""I think that's the biggest thing."" Halfway through the second period, the Tigers had a series of shots but could not find the net. A Providence player intercepted the Tigers and, taking the puck up on the left wing, launched the puck at Princeton's net. Nevo slid on her knees to her left, blocking the shot. ""It was all instinct,"" she later said. Friday's game marked the 17-year-old goaltender's first career start and shutout. Throughout the game, she made 20 saves for the team. The competition increased in the third period as the Friars tried to come back, while Princeton fought to defend its lead. With nine minutes left in the game, the Friars were able to connect a string of passes to a forward for a shot, but it was blocked again by Nevo. Princeton maintained solid possession for the rest of the game. With one minute left, sophomore right wing Mackenzie Alexander scored an empty netter, locking in the Tiger victory of 3-0. Headed into their second game at Baker Rink, Princeton sought to assert victory again and beat a revenge-hungy Providence. The first period began with intense battles and lots of physicality. With eight minutes left in the period, Nimegeers entered a competitive 1-on-1 with a Providence defender. Nimegeers slashed the Friar's stick, receiving the first penalty of the game. In the power play that followed, Friar forward Audrey Knapp drove past Princeton's defense with impressive stick handling skills and slipped a backhanded shot into the goal, putting Providence in the lead 1-0. However, the Tigers did not let this stop them. Sending up numbers into the offensive zone, the Tigers pressed the Friar defense. Senior forward Jane Kuehl found the puck and passed it to first-year defender Catie Collins. Collins launched it to the back of the net, scoring her first career goal and flattening out the score at 1-1. In the second period, the Tigers extended their lead. On a power play, sophomore forward Angelina DiGirolamo took a shot that did not find the net, but Kuehl was able to pick it up and send it in, setting Princeton ahead 2-1. In the final moments of the third period, Princeton's defense capitalized on a turnover and Wunder sent the puck up toward the goal. With a single second left in the game, Alexander drove it into the goal and secured the victory of 3-1 with another empty net goal, her second of the series. The Tigers will look to build on this momentum when they face the No. 7 Quinnipiac Bobcats at Baker Rink this Thursday at 6 p.m. Isa Mena is a Sports contributor for the 'Prince.'

"No. 3 men's soccer tops Cornell 2-0, completing Ivy League regular season and tournament sweep","Top Stories, Sports, top-story, homepage, m-sports, Ivy League championships, Ivy League, sports-recaps",Hayk Yengibaryan,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:35:52 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-mens-soccer-defeats-cornell-big-red-ivy-league-tournament-title-ncaa-tournament-college-cup,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-mens-soccer-defeats-cornell-big-red-ivy-league-tournament-title-ncaa-tournament-college-cup,"In a season already defined by firsts, No. 3 men's soccer (15-1-2 overall, 9-0 Ivy League) added another historic chapter on Sunday afternoon. The Tigers defeated the No. 20 overall Cornell Big Red (13-3-2, 5-1-1) 2-0, clinching the Ivy League tournament title and coming even closer to an unprecedented No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. ""It's kind of unbelievable,"" junior midfielder Liam Beckwith told The Daily Princetonian. ""This past summer, when I was talking with teammates, we had high hopes for the team. We knew we were gonna be good, but we didn't know we were gonna be this good."" With the win, the Tigers became the first team to win both the Ivy League regular season championship and the conference tournament, which was introduced in 2023. In its nine total conference games, Princeton has outscored the rest of the Ancient Eight 17-1. ""Cornell's a really good team and they move the ball well, they're tenacious and have so many ways of getting dangerous,"" said Head Coach Jim Barlow '91. ""They were a little unlucky with their finishing today. I expect them to go far in the [NCAA] tournament."" The Tigers got on the board early as senior midfielder Sam Vigilante scored off a pass from Beckwith. The defining moment in the game came late in the first half when junior goalkeeper Andrew Samuels blocked a penalty kick from Cornell forward Kasper Wollstein. ""If they score that goal, that's a very different second half,"" Samuels said of his mindset in the moment. ""We know our biggest strength is our defending, so I've got to do everything I can to stop that."" As the visitors kept pushing for the equalizer, Beckwith sealed the title for the Tigers in the 88th minute. Cornell Head Coach John Smith told the 'Prince' that, ahead of the game, he didn't see ""any real glaring weaknesses"" in Princeton. He added that the Tigers ""are physically mature and emotionally mature … they're experienced and they've got good balance all over the field."" Next up for the Orange and Black will be the NCAA tournament. Upsets elsewhere - No. 1 Maryland (12-1-3, 8-0-2 Big Ten) falling to unranked UCLA (7-6-4, 5-3-2) in the Big Ten semifinals and No. 4 Virginia (12-2-4, 5-0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) losing 1-0 to No. 25 SMU (11-4-4, 3-2-3) in the ACC title game - have opened the door for Princeton to contend for the top overall seed. ""It just means one game,"" Barlow said. ""We just gotta win the next game, that's been the guys mentality all year."" The committee will likely decide between the Tigers and the defending champion Vermont Catamounts (14-0-5, 6-0-1 America East) for the No. 1 overall seed. Regardless, the Tigers will host at Roberts Stadium through the NCAA quarterfinal game, should they make it to that stage of the tournament. Weather dictated much of the first half. Wind gusts nearing 40 miles per hour made the pitch unpredictable and forced both sides to adjust on the fly. ""It was a bit of a cagey start,"" Smith said. ""Princeton deservedly scored within that period of time. Beyond that, we started to work our way into the game."" Vigilante's goal came in the sixth minute after a free kick from senior defender Jack Jasinski was parried away by Cornell goalkeeper Ryan Friedberg. Beckwith collected the rebound, beat his defender, and cut the ball back to Vigilante, who placed his shot perfectly past Friedberg. VIGILANTE. CLINICAL.

""He's kind of the heart and soul of the group in terms of how much ground he covers and how many balls he wins and now he's getting his goals too."" For the Tigers, it was the sixth time this season where they've scored within the first 16 minutes of the first half. ""With a group that defends so well, it's awesome to get an early goal because it gives us confidence that now the other team is really gonna have to push to get a goal, and that might open things up for us,"" Barlow said. But the best chance of the half came in the 43rd minute when first-year midfielder Tyler Vilet fouled Cornell midfielder Westin Carnevale in the 18-yard box. After a video review, the visitors were awarded a penalty. The one man standing between Cornell and the equalizer was Samuels. The Ivy League defensive player of the year guessed correctly and made the stop, his third penalty save of the season.

""I tell one of my teammates before the game where I'm going, but then if I see how his run-up changes, I'll change it up a bit, but I'd like to go in with a set idea of what I want to do."" Heading into the locker room, the possession battle was dead even, and although the Big Red outshot Princeton nine to four, their only effort on target came from the penalty spot. The second half opened up quickly. In the 59th minute, Cornell defender Aidan Martin's shot was just inches away from finding the back of the net. As Cornell continued to try to find the equalizer, so did the counterattack opportunities for Princeton. In the 71st minute, it was senior forward Daniel Ittycheria weaving through the defense just for his shot to hit the crossbar. ""By the end of it, we were just pushing everybody forward and left ourselves exposed,"" Smith said. The final look for the visitors came in the 86th minute when midfielder Campbell Reece's shot went just over the goal. Desperate for the equalizer, Cornell was left scrambling in the back in the 88th minute. Vigilante played the through ball into Beckwith, who chipped the goalie to double the Tiger lead and seal the title for Barlow's squad.

Princeton Pianists Ensemble takes listeners on an 'odyssey' through genres,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Prospect, Arts",Annika Plunkett,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:29:29 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-princeton-piano-ensemble-odyssey-performance,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-princeton-piano-ensemble-odyssey-performance,"Five pianos arranged in a quasi-star shape on stage, five pianists, and a lot of cheers. The Princeton Pianists Ensemble concert was about to begin. On Tuesday at 8 p.m., Princeton Pianists Ensemble (PPE) performed their concert ""Odyssey,"" which featured 10 pieces and around 50 pianists. ""Odyssey"" wove a musical journey through classical melodies, pop tunes, and more. The pianists opened with a funky, Japanese pop-inspired melody ""City Pop: Greatest Hits."" As the song neared its end, the pianists gathered around one piano, just in time for the final notes. It was the first hint that this would be a true performance, not just a concert, as the pianists regularly incorporated movement from piano to piano, physical gestures, and other instruments into the show. The program included an eclectic mix of pieces, ranging from an arrangement from the ""Mamma Mia!"" soundtrack to works inspired by classical composers like Maurice Ravel. ""Every piece brings something different to the table,"" PPE Music Director Brianna Dai '28 told The Daily Princetonian. Despite the diverse musical genres and the lack of chronology in the program order, the organization wasn't jarring. The pieces complemented each other, balancing more modern and upbeat pieces with older or more emotive ones, creating a musical voyage. ""This concert is really about the journey music can take you on because each piece feels like a different stop along the way,"" Dai said. ""Some are nostalgic, some are cinematic, some are just plain epic."" Each of the 10 pieces (and the lively K-Pop inspired encore) in the concert felt ""epic"" in some respect or another. The pianists' mastery throughout the concert was also evident. It wasn't just that some played entirely from memory, so familiar with the music that they no longer needed the score. It was the subtle nods to each other across the stage, cueing each other in, and the sheer joy evident in their smiles that made the performance so memorable. For each piece, the performers combined that joy with technical talent, especially notable in the fifth piece, a hilarious and concentration-intensive rendition of ""Boléro."" This Spanish-inspired melody was originally arranged by Ravel. The piece began with a driving, light, snare drum-like rhythm. One pianist, Bedros Maldjian '26, kept that pulse for the entire piece as more pianists filed on stage and the music ultimately crescendoed into the finale. I was blown away by his concentration, as he kept the same tempo and subdivision while other melodies were playing, and even more so when the pianist sharing the keyboard was playing the piano in such an unusual manner. His partner at the piano, Anthony Coniglio GS, had the audience chuckling as he - also remarkably in time - played the piano with his head, his elbow, a pencil, and a tennis ball. ""We just want to show that, yes, 'serious' piano music and 'fun' piano music don't have to be separate things,"" Dai said. I also enjoyed the third piece, entitled ""Your Name Medley."" Featuring five pianos and a violin, the piece began slowly, then became more staccato for a moment before evolving into a beautiful rolling melody. Just as it seemed that the music could not become more heartfelt, one pianist stood up and began playing the violin, first adding rhythm and then taking the melody. Combined with the four pianos, the sound was rich and raw. All the pieces were arranged and directed by members of the ensemble, which is independent of the music department. ""That's what makes it so meaningful,"" Dai told the 'Prince.' ""It's all about what students want in the club, because we don't want people playing just to play. We want them to be playing and creating and investing a part of themselves into the work that we do, what we perform, and what we give to the audience."" The connection between the pianists and the audience was clear during the entire two-hour show. I particularly noticed it during ""Photograph + I Hear a Symphony,"" an intimate piece with a simple central melody that branched into something much more dramatic. The performers conveyed that intimacy with the audience with a hushed moment of silence before applause rang. ""I absolutely loved the show,"" Lucy Park '28 said. ""It was a nice mix of classical and more contemporary and pop culture-like music repertoire … and the encore was so cute."" ""Our whole goal is to make beautiful music accessible. You don't have to be a classical music expert to enjoy what we do. You just have to be open to … feeling something; that's what is important,"" Dai said.

Coffee Club heats things up with their new winter menu,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, review, Prospect, Lifestyle",Eesha Sutaria,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:22:30 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-lifestyle-coffee-club-winter-drinks-mocha-matcha-cocoa-latte,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-lifestyle-coffee-club-winter-drinks-mocha-matcha-cocoa-latte,"As the temperatures drop and finals season approaches, Coffee Club has dropped a new slate of seasonal drinks to keep students warm and power them through the end of the semester. Here's the 2025 winter lineup, ranked from what I am least likely to most likely order again. 5. Mistletoe Matcha Though I'm not a big matcha fan, I couldn't imagine that matcha lovers would want this under the mistletoe. Offered in both hot and iced, I opted for the cold version. The drink was described as a flavor combination of pistachio and matcha. My main struggle was the lack of sweetener. The pistachio added nuttiness to the drink, but it failed to counter the bitterness of the matcha. The matcha was lacking in quality and, despite the addition of the pistachio, did not have a complex flavor profile. Instead, the drink was overwhelmed by bitterness. The drink was quite milky, and the pistachio only came to the forefront in the aftertaste. 4. Cozy Cabin Latte Drinking this warm latte left me feeling cozy inside. While I enjoyed the Cozy Cabin Latte, it was missing the advertised notes of cinnamon and toffee. It was offered both hot and cold, and I chose the warm version. I tasted and felt the warmth of the cinnamon, but none of the toffee flavor came through. The sweetness of the drink was perfect for me - noticeable but subtle. The sugar balanced both the milkiness and the flavor of coffee. The Cozy Cabin Latte was sweet, but it was not an excessively sweet drink. The frothiness and milkiness of the latte were delectable and defining features of the drink. While a quality latte, it didn't live up to its branding as a seasonal drink with a specific flavor palette. 3. Flapjack Flat White While this drink was advertised as a pancake-inspired beverage with a robust espresso flavor and real maple, this drink ""flat"" out tasted like coffee. The strength of the coffee and the sweetness of the maple complemented each other. Although the sweetness provided a deeper profile to the drink, the maple flavor was lacking. This is the only drink on the seasonal menu where I could distinctly taste the coffee. 2. Very Merry Mocha This drink lived up to its name and left me feeling very merry once I finished it. The chocolate component of the mocha was very noticeable, almost like hot chocolate with the slightest addition of coffee flavor. Advertised with a minty profile, there was a hint of peppermint in the aftertaste. The Very Merry Mocha overall had strong notes of chocolate. For lovers of coffee and chocolate, this drink has a pleasant mix of flavors. This is perfect if you are in the mood for something chocolatey but want a hint of caffeine and peppermint. 1. Fireside Hot Cocoa I would love to sit by the fireside and sip another one of these drinks. This tasted exactly as it was advertised and had the strongest connection between the description and the true flavor. Notes of standout cayenne and cinnamon were particularly strong. The foam compensated for a lack of whipped cream, and the drink fulfilled a craving for chocolate with a richer flavor than mere sweetness. The chocolate was not too dark or too sweet. I would order it again because it is truly a seasonal flavor enhanced by the spiciness of the cayenne in the delicious hot chocolate.

The International Student Experience Working Group reported on a recent meeting with the Davis International Center (Davis IC).According to Genevieve Shutt '26, a member of the working group, the Davis IC asked them to gather international students' perspectives on the potential loss of early housing access over winter break due to the end of Wintersession. ""We've been able to find out from Dean Gordin that approximately 100 students are approved to be on campus for continuous housing when the University is closed in December,"" Shutt said. ""We're finding ways to increase transparency of what this process would look like and take the burden away from Davis."" The working group also aims to support international students by addressing the 14 percent withholding tax rate on financial aid above the cost of tuition. During the meeting, U-Councilor Angela Li '28 noted that a tax information session for international students will be held earlier in the upcoming Spring semester than in previous years ""to give international students better time to prepare for questions regarding tax filing."" Li is an assistant Features editor for The Daily Princetonian. The Financial Aid Office is also currently working on a revamp of the financial aid portal. ""The next steps ... are to send a survey to international students and email the financial aid office regarding concrete steps to revamp the website with more clarity and better information,"" Li said. The Senate then recapped the work of the Athletics Working Group, which aims to increase turnout and student engagement at athletic events. Class of 2027 Senator Siddhant Shah '27 said that this semester saw the most programming for athletic events from USG in history, with $9,000 of the group's $10,000 budgetalready put to use. ""We've been ordering Pizza Den,"" Shah said. ""Huge upgrade from Papa John's. We have the budget for it, super happy about that."" During the meeting, USG President Enzo Kho '26 congratulated the Senate on the USG's 50th anniversary celebration and highlighted TigerTies, hosted on Saturday by the Social Committee and the Diversity and Equity Committee. The five constitutional amendments announced on Nov. 2 all passed their second vote during this week's meeting. The Senate then voted to move into executive session in preparation for next week's presentation from the Mental Health Committee.

"Joe Manchin's remarks inspire unity, but not how you might think","Opinion, Columns",Ian Rosenzweig,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:07:40 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-opinion-column-joe-manchin-populism-unity-public-service,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-opinion-column-joe-manchin-populism-unity-public-service,"On Nov. 8, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society presented former West Virginia Senator Joseph Manchin III with the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service - the society's highest honor . I've followed Senator Manchin fairly closely in recent years. His exit from the Senate this past January, along with fellow Democrat-turned-Independent Kyrsten Sinema, signaled that the bipartisanship these two centrists favored was a way of the past; upon her exit, Sinema remarked that, in today's environment, "" compromise is a dirty word ."" Knowing this history, I thought that Senator Manchin's remarks at Princeton would center on promoting consensus amidst political division. But the senator's policy platform, like his ardent support for the filibuster and term limits, was not my key takeaway from the talk. More essential to his message was a conviction that he highlights in his 2025 memoir ""Dead Center"": public service is about serving the people, and political leaders are meant to represent their constituency, not themselves. Manchin's commitment to representing his constituents and ensuring that no American is left behind features prominently in the rhetoric of today's electoral victors, including Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani. As students at an elite institution, we all stand to benefit from understanding how leading in a way that stands up for, and represents the interests of, every American is a winning formula that seems to resonate with Americans across the political spectrum. Princetonians of all political orientations, especially those who want to be in public service, should recognize that we share good-faith goals of representing the everyman, even and especially with our political opponents. Donald Trump's 2016 campaign positioned Trump, an economic but not a political elite, as an outsider who would ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. Both of Trump's winning campaigns espoused messages that resonated with the ""common man."" In essence, the ""America First"" agenda is, at least nominally, about representing Americans who feel left behind by elite politicians. And Trump's success is only one example of the popularity of promises of authentic, people-oriented representation. Similarly, Zohran Mamdani spoke to New Yorkers who were struggling with the cost of living , promising that they were just as important as the wealthy New York elite. Mamdani, a junior assemblyman, rose from obscurity to secure the Democratic nomination, a sign of the public's desire for representation and their rejection of the political machine exemplified by runner-up Andrew Cuomo. It's true that left- and right-wing promises of representation focus on different people whom they consider ""left behind."" Trump often targeted messaging to factory workers in the American Heartland whose jobs went overseas, while Mamdani spoke to young voters concerned about cost of living. But nonetheless, in true centrist fashion, Manchin's message has potential to appeal to voters on both sides. This people-centric brand of politics is not just relevant to, say, a SPIA major whose goal is to hold elected office. Princeton's own elected officials can take notes from Manchin's message. Undergraduate Student Government perhaps faces a greater challenge in that their electorate does not actively express such a desire for representation; many students are, at best, indifferent toward the actions of USG. So USG must determine how, with such a diverse spread of ""public"" sentiment, they can still serve as a body that is representative of student interests and earn the active support that may result from a more Manchin-esque approach. In the real world, the Princeton degree comes with some baggage. Whether we agree or not, Princeton and the Ivy League are often symbols of elite power in the United States. Manchin's message about the value of truly representative public service shows that, given Americans' recent attitude toward elites and support for promises of representation, it is incumbent upon Princetonians who hope to enter public service, whether through organizing or running for elected office, to prove that they are worthy of a vote. In that sense, Senator Manchin's message draws upon citizens' fundamental democratic desire for a voice. A Trump voter and a Mamdani voter are unlikely to find common ground on many policy issues. But regarding their end goal - finding representation - they align. No matter their background and no matter their identification with the ideological left or right, Princetonians who are engaged in civic service should unite around a shared goal of representation. In a polarized political environment, that glimmer of unity could be the common ground that brings left and right together - a fitting outcome of Manchin's goals and a truly noble pursuit. Ian Rosenzweig '29 is a prospective SPIA major from Bryn Mawr, Penn. who thinks that even the slightest bit of common ground is a beacon of hope for political unity.

A is for authoritarianism,"Opinion, Columns",Siyeon Lee,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:06:50 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-opinion-column-harvard-grade-inflation-perfectionism-failure,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-opinion-column-harvard-grade-inflation-perfectionism-failure,"A few weeks ago, a student was quoted in the Harvard Crimson calling a report on grade inflation ""soul-crushing."" In the article, students - mostly freshmen - are daunted by the implications of a more rigorous grading system. Students were worried that their hard work might not always translate into an A-range grade (which, for Harvard students, occurs nearly 80% of the time). I myself have been upset about a bad grade - on Sunday, I received a disappointing grade on a midterm essay I worked for hours on. But too many times have I heard stories about my peers bursting into tears during office hours, begging for a B+ to be raised to an A-, or wrangling with professors after precepts to explain why they 'deserve' a higher grade on an assignment. Princeton's grading seems punishing in comparison to Harvard's, so much so that the Crimson's Editorial Board makes it the butt of their joke in their piece : ""Princeton students seem to be faring just fine,"" they wrote in a recent column. While it's easy to make fun of Harvard for being easier than Princeton, a culture of academic perfectionism still clouds the words of any conversation about grading at either institution. For institutions like Princeton and Harvard - that will inevitably produce part of the next crop of leaders around the world- it is imperative that students are truly prepared and willing to face critique, hardship, and even failure. That starts with a grading philosophy that doesn't immediately equate high performance with high effort. But it also involves rejecting a culture of academic perfectionism that places our self-worth hand-in-hand with a class grade. Institutions like Princeton and Harvard house some of the most talented young minds in the country. Many of us will indubitably enter into professions or hold powerful roles that will help shape the nation's politics, law, and public discourse. In a world where high academic performance is reduced to a credential that parallels our self-worth, though, it's easy to berate ourselves and catastrophize over what we take to be personal failures. Academic perfectionism is a prerequisite for self-worth - it justifies, we feel, our presence here. If we receive anything other than an A, we feel as though we were wronged - because effort and hard work have become a mistaken shorthand for excellence. A culture that incentivizes this type of negative thinking - combined with a grading system like that of Harvard's - prepares us poorly for the failures we will undoubtedly encounter in our future. After graduation, some of us might go on to write books that are unexpectedly controversial, draft policies for hours only for them to eventually fail, or drop a developing petri dish integral to a research paper. Our discomfort makes us averse to growth and change, and most importantly, accountability. Like an authoritarian dictator who crushes all dissent in the name of political preservation, we become allergic to anything that suggests any possibility of inadequacy. Authoritarianism demands the limitation of any kind of opposition to a central power. But only through a willingness to hold ourselves accountable can we accept opposition with grace. When we've been conditioned to see any failure as a parallel representation of our inherent deficiencies, any kind of critique is bound to be taken as a personal attack. This is not to say that things like grade inflation or perfectionism produce authoritarianism, or that caring about a bad grade makes you a fascist. It's more to say that academic perfectionism can dull our ability to recognize our own authoritarian tendencies because together they share a flawed reasoning that faultlessness reflects one's value. But when we condition ourselves to view academic accomplishment as a given based on hard work, we risk falling into the same pattern of thinking with our future professions. A position in local office becomes a reward for hard work, instead of a public-facing role where addressing disagreement, scrutiny, and shortcomings should be baked into the position. A role at a lab, a newsroom, or a firm becomes something we are entitled to as opposed to a place where failure is both possible and instructive. While grade inflation and perfectionism might not directly create authoritarians, they can create graduates who struggle to hear that they are wrong and conflate any form of critique with a personal attack. If we cannot tolerate being imperfect on our transcript, surrounded by those who want to help us grow, how will we handle being wrong when the stakes are higher?

Field Hockey stops the Stags: Princeton wins Sweet Sixteen game 3-1,"Top Stories, Sports, top-story, Field Hockey, homepage, w-sports, sports-recaps",Emilia Reay,"Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:46:32 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-field-hockey-sweet-sixteen-win-fairfield,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-field-hockey-sweet-sixteen-win-fairfield,"No. 2 Field Hockey (16-3 overall, 6-1 Ivy League) beat the Fairfield Stags (16-6, 9-0 Northeast Conference) 3-1 to advance to the Elite Eight on Saturday, continuing a historically deep run for the Tigers. Princeton played the game without junior captain and midfielder Ella Cashman, who suffered a torn ACL in their first Ivy League Tournament title win. Cashman had facilitated much of the Tigers' patient passing. First-year Tabby Vaughan got the start against the Stags in her place. ""The whole training yesterday she was hyping me up and giving me lots of love. I was really excited to play, but it's obviously heart-breaking for Cash,"" Vaughan told The Daily Princetonian. Despite the lineup changes, the Tigers turned on the gas to open the game. Not even three minutes into the action, sophomore defender Izzy Morgan found the back of the cage off an assist from sophomore midfielder Anna Faulstich. ""It was awesome. It was a backpost goal - something we had really been working on,"" Morgan said. ""I saw Anna with an opportunity and I called to her."" Princeton comfortably brought the ball into the Stags' circle and beyond the 25 for the remainder of the quarter. No other goals were recorded after the first 15 minutes ended, making it 1-0 Tigers. The second quarter started with a corner for the Stags, the first of the game, who managed to equalize with a simple pass to the edge of the shooting circle and a shot which was deflected into the top corner of the Princeton net. Without Cashman's presence to protect Tiger territory, Fairfield's offensive effort overwhelmed the Princeton defensive penalty corner unit, scoring a goal. Princeton fans didn't have to worry for long, however. With about six minutes left in the half, senior midfielder Beth Yeager connected on a drag flick to make the score 2-1. ""'Step up defensively and be more aggressive.' I thought we were letting them [Fairfield] receive too easily,"" Head Coach Carla Tagliente told the 'Prince' about her advice to the team during the halftime break. ""'Open them up a little bit more.' We were playing a bit too much ping pong back and forth. 'Control the pace of the game.'"" After the halftime recess, Fairfield came out fired up. Both teams would gather possessions, but as quickly as they would secure the ball, the other team would take it away. Neither team scored in the third, although Princeton was able to keep the ball on the Stags' side of the field for the majority of the quarter. ""We all knew it [scoring] was coming,"" Vaughan said about the scoreless third quarter. ""I think we were all just trying to keep positive, keep the emotions high. We were getting a bit frustrated with each other, but we knew we could do this as a team."" With five minutes left to play, Fairfield took their goalie out of the game and added an extra field athlete into the mix. A shot by senior defender Ella Hampson a few minutes later didn't even have to make it past the keeper, securing a 3-1 Princeton victory. The Tigers are now in the Elite Eight and are set to play against Syracuse on Sunday at 1 p.m. back on Bedford Field. Syracuse handed Princeton one of their three losses of the season in overtime. The Orange and Black versus the Orange and Blue is one of the most anticipated games in this bracket.

American art pavilion sparks dialogue on America's past and future,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, review, Prospect, Princeton University Art Museum",Caroline Naughton,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:52:44 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-art-museum-american-pavilion-sparks-dialogue-on-past-and-future,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-art-museum-american-pavilion-sparks-dialogue-on-past-and-future,"Standing valiantly in front of an active battleground and Nassau Hall in the distance, ""George Washington at the Battle of Princeton"" by Charles Willson Peale was one of the first paintings acquired by Princeton and, fittingly, the first one to be hung in the new art museum itself. The painting is a reminder of the longstanding history of Princeton and acts as a beacon for visitors of the Wilmerding Pavilion of American Art, asking them to explore and confront both the curated space and their ideas of America itself. While the organization of the gallery can be disorienting at times, the pavilion is an intriguing take on the difficult task of representing the complexities of American history and identity. While I had briefly spent some time in the pavilion during the museum's student preview on Oct. 24, it wasn't until my personal tour withKarl Kusserow, senior curator of American Art, that I truly digested it in full. ""A hallmark of this institution,"" Kusserow said, ""is the kind of mixing up of works of art from different places and different periods of time to suggest different ways of understanding. This whole installation is organized around that kind of juxtaposition."" To this point, the pavilion attempts to prompt viewers to piece together the nuances of American history themselves, inviting discussions on protest movements, gender, and environmental justice. The first example of this juxtaposition is in the arrangement of the George Washington display. The famous painting that greets all visitors of the pavilion is flanked by two busts of the first president. One, is cast in bronze and was previously owned by Thomas Jefferson, while the other, made of a metallic mirror-like material, was created by Alan Michelson, a Native American artist. The piece, titled ""Hanödaga:yas (Town Destroyer): Reflect,"" was specially commissioned for the Museum. Made from a highly reflective material, the bust forces viewers to confront their own image and, in turn, Washington's imprint on America. The bust's base is made from a salvaged piece of ash to represent the burning of Native American villages. When discussing the mistreatment of Native Americans and African Americans throughout American history, Kusserow said, ""We try, in this pavilion, to engage the idea that it's not just a matter of victimhood. ""They expressed their own agency in sort of combating a lot of the injustices that were inflicted on them,"" he added. Indeed, interconnectedness is the pavilion's guiding principle. Pieces that seem unrelated at first glance enter into conversation when placed together. For example, ""The Culprit Fay"" by John Adams Jackson is a sculpture carved from marble from Carrara, a region in Italy scarred by centuries of mining exploitation. This sculpture sits opposite a clay jar by Pueblo artist Maria Martinez, who gathered her materials from the earth after seeking spiritual permission. Together, these pieces illustrate the contrast between Western exploitation of nature and Indigenous stewardship of it. Opposite this arrangement is a display with similar messaging, an arrangement of various still lifes from the 19th century. Hung in chronological order, the earliest painting depicts natural produce with an arrangement of peaches. However, as the chronology advances, nature soon gives way to the man-made, transitioning to natural products like cheese and champagne, and eventually to solely manufactured goods. This progression reflects a shift from harmony with nature to domination over it, mirroring America's industrial and environmental trajectory. In the very back of the pavilion lies the arts and crafts section,by far my favorite as someone interested in both textiles and ceramics. In a glass box display, there were several Tiffany glass designs and ceramic items, all in organic shapes that contrasted the manufactured approach of the time period.Some of the display's ceramic items are classified as Newcomb Pottery, a firm that evolved from Tulane's Newcomb College for women During a lull in our conversation, Kusserow pointed me toward his favorite wall in the pavilion, showcasing two quaint landscapes: one of ships in a harbor, and the other a nameless marsh. While unassuming beside the Bierstadt landscape, these pieces emphasize the interconnected thinking behind the curation of this gallery. Another notable moment of contrast lies around the corner from the Washington portrait in the Libby Anschutz Gallery. Here, Renee Cox's revisionist photograph, ""The Signing,"" emulates the famous ""The Signing of the Constitution"" painting, replacing the founding fathers with people of color. Just beside this powerful photograph sits the massive painting by Thomas Sully of Mrs. Reverdy Johnson, the wife of Reverdy Johnson, the lawyer of the slaveowner in the Dred Scott decision. The connection between the two pieces took me aback; it felt as though history was confronting itself in this little corner of the museum. While thought-provoking, the displays can also read as busy and disjointed. I felt the logic behind the pavilion's curation best revealed itself after taking extended time to linger on each work. While it is likely not possible for a casual museum guest to reflect on each arrangement in the American pavilion, it is a meaningful endeavor for those who take the time. In the end, the pavilion's strength lies not in seamless order, but in its deliberate tension. Those who take the time to read, to look, and to think will find that the pavilion offers not just a gallery of art, but a space for a dialogue that challenges, questions, and, ultimately reimagines the story of a nation.

'Princeton Collects' is too chaotic for cohesion,"Top Stories, news, top-story, homepage, Princeton University Art Museum",Sena Chang,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:51:19 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-art-museum-pavillion-review-princeton-collects,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-art-museum-pavillion-review-princeton-collects,"In no other room than the ""Princeton Collects"" exhibition could a punch bowl from China's Qing Dynasty, a skirt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and a Willem de Kooning oil painting sit so close to one other. The exhibition - borderless, eclectic, and cross-temporal - is located in the southeast pavilion of the new art museum, one of two main temporary exhibition spaces. ""Princeton Collects"" celebrates more than 2,000 works donated to the museum by more than 200 members of the Princeton community between 2021 and 2025. Around 150 works are on view in this inaugural exhibition. From abstract Expressionist canvases to 19th-century British portraiture and Chinese earthenware, ""it is … impossible to impose on such sprawling gifts a single organizing principle,"" the pavilion description reads. At first glance, the effect can be dizzying. The high-ceilinged room, combined with the lack of a cohesive theme or motif, struggles to orient the visitor as they enter. Immediately after a towering wall featuring donors' names, sculptures of all sizes stand at the center, with photographs of tattoos and oil paintings housed in frames big and small on the wall behind. Everything and nothing draws your attention. The further you venture inside, the more messy the pavilion appears. Ai Weiwei's ""Porcelain Cube"" (2009), an ornate three-dimensional ceramic cube, sits in the center of a collection of oil paintings. Nari Ward's ""Scape"" (2012), a shredded fabric ladder, stands just around the corner from the cube.At every turn, you are hit with an amalgamation of diverse artistic media - fabric, ceramic, painting, and photography - that at times feel overwhelming and excessive. Even the positioning of certain objects - for example, a Qing-era Punch bowl sitting below an etching and engraving depicting William Hogarth's ""The Gate of Calais or The Roast Beef of Old England"" (1748-49) - can seem almost arbitrarily placed with no concern for visual or historical continuity. Upon closer inspection, however, viewers will see a deeper artistic connection between the two works. As the punch bowl's didactic reveals, the Chinese pottery showcases a reinterpretation of Hogarth's painting. The two works, in effect, embody the circulation of ideas and aesthetics along trade routes that connected two very different worlds. In these ways, moments of cohesion emerge from the exhibition's apparent chaos as artworks reveal unexpected continuities across such an eclectic collection. Connections are made between seemingly disparate artworks, helping the viewer make sense of the visual commotion that permeates the pavilion. For all its eclecticism, visitors enjoyed the diverse works of art showcased in the pavilion. ""I like that the colors don't match,"" said Elizabeth Watson of Ewing, N.J. ""The pieces go together, but it's because somebody had a wonderfully fun time figuring out what goes with something else - I think that adds to the visual intrigue."" Amid the visual noise of the space, anchoring the exhibition is Irish artist Sean Scully's ""Night and Day"" (2012), a massive painting of white, gray, and milky rectangles. Around it, tigers on ancient papyrus, porcelain deities, and oil landscapes draw viewers into fleeting visual affinities rather than clear narratives. Meanwhile, the set of Asian scrolls adjacent to Scully's painting features works from 1761, the mid-1800s, and 2006, spanning Japan and China. These unexpected dialogues between time and geography lend credence to the pavilion's description of a ""museum in miniature."" ""The collection is so big, and the way the materials are presented just keeps me interested,"" Watson said. ""Just keeps me looking, and looking, and looking, and exclaiming."" Still, ""Princeton Collects"" occasionally feels less cohesive than other pavilions in the museum; in some ways, its lack of a unifying artistic theme feels foreign within the broader museum, where pavilions are mainly grouped by geography. While the exhibition succeeds as a study in contrast and cross-cultural influences, its spatial isolation raises questions about curatorial strategy.The thematic looseness - though deliberate - can leave visitors unsure of where to look or how to linger. The exhibition seems noticeably quieter than its neighboring collections, with viewers drifting in and out in a matter of minutes. The spirit of the exhibition, however, is a fitting debut for the new museum, inviting viewers to reconsider how art travels, adapts, and accrues meaning across time and culture. ""Princeton Collects"" mirrors the museum's own moment of renewal, using the renovated architecture and non-hierarchical organization to invite visitors to think about connections between eras, materials, and makers. The pavilion's simple layout, coupled with lots of open space, makes the pavilion easily re-purposable for future temporary exhibitions. But the current exhibition fails to bring together the space.

Eclectic pairings and interconnecting cultures: Transition spaces in the art museum,"Top Stories, news, top-story, homepage, Princeton University Art Museum",Haeon Lee,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:50:30 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-news-art-museum-pavilion-review-hallways,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-news-art-museum-pavilion-review-hallways,"In the Princeton University Art Museum, the art is everywhere - including in the hallways. Upon ascending the Grand Stair of the museum up to the collections, the first pieces of art that many visitors see are those of the Orientation Gallery, which rings around the main staircase. Before even entering one of the seven pavilions dedicated to art, visitors pass through various hallways and transitional areas that double as compactgalleries dedicated to art from the Islamic World, Latin America, Native North America, South Asia, and Africa. The Orientation Gallery makes up one of the most unique areas of the whole museum, with works such as Andy Warhol's ""Blue Marilyn"" (1962) juxtaposed against a long assortment of European Renaissance stained glass pieces. ""I like the mix of modern and ancient, the mix of time frames. I can't think of another museum where I've seen that,"" saidSherry Friend, docent at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art, during a visit to the museum. ""The opening to the second floor of the museum is highlighting the fame of the museum, the fame of Princeton, and the caliber of art that they're able to collect with their means,"" said Madison Anderson '27, an art history major and former member of the museum's Student Advisory Board. ""Some galleries also serve as circulation spaces, we don't see any of the gallery spaces in the building as 'hallways,'"" said Art Museum spokesperson Morgan Gengo. Rather than simply connecting one gallery to the next, the circulation spaces present visitors with an unpredictable and diverse array of pieces. Tall glass cases above the Grand Hall, for instance, house a dizzying array of bowls, vases, and objects from a broad array of cultures. Meanwhile, the Cross-Collections Gallery, located just outside of the Asian Art Pavilion, builds Josiah McElheny's ""A Twilight Labyrinth (Alchemy)"" (2019) into a wall near a Spanish alabaster carving of a knight from circa 1500. But unlike areas like American, modern, and ancient Mediterranean art, which have dedicated pavilions, the museum's African and Latin American art is largely showcased in the hallways. ""The museum, I know for a fact, has a very strong Latin American art collection … and the Latin American Gallery of Art is quite literally a corner,"" Anderson told the 'Prince.' Perrin LathropGS '21, Associate Curator of African Art at the museum, wrote in a statement that the ""interstitial galleries emphasize ideas of cultural contact and exchange."" African and Latin American art galleries ""are present throughout the museum and are inescapable,"" she added. ""You can't escape the fact that there will be art in that hallway,"" Anderson said. ""You're going to have to pass by it, so why not look?"" Before the museum's renovation, European, American, and contemporary art dominated the main upstairs floor, while non-Western art was placed in the downstairs galleries, where there were fewer visitors. ""The new museum, by putting art on the same physical level, helps convey that all art is important, it's valuable,"" said Annemarie Iker GS '24, a scholar of modern art. ""The African art galleries have increased in size by some 700% from the previous building and are strategically located adjacent to the galleries for art of the Islamic world and the ancient Mediterranean,"" Lathrop added. Many of the pieces on display in the African art collection are attributed to an ""Artist unrecorded,"" a label that Lathrop wrote ""recognizes the individuality of the person who created the work, before providing information about their culture and geographic origin."" The attribution ""serves as a corrective to the ways that the international circulation of their work, especially during the colonial era, erased their individuality,"" Lathrop wrote. Similarly, the Latin American and North Native American art galleries, located by the entrance to the American art pavilion, include many ceramic figures, vessels, and objects by artists that are unidentified, such as the ""Model yaakw (canoe)"" (before 1882). Most modern art from the cultures showcased in the transition spaces, however, is located in the Modern and Contemporary art pavilion. ""I'm not sure how much of this at the time people would have thought of as art,"" Friend said, adding that the frequency of unnamed artists for certain cultures may be a consequence of the blurred line between art and product. From iconic paintings of mythological and historical scenes to obscure Attic  and ceramic Olmec pottery, the museum's transitional spaces have much to offer. Despite not having their own dedicated pavilions, the African, South Asian, Native North American, and Latin American art scattered across the museum's second-floor galleries provides visitors with the opportunity to learn about the cultural histories, traditions, and identities of artists from around the world.

Princeton University Art Museum: By the Numbers,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, data, Princeton University Art Museum",Aayush Mitra,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:49:05 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-data-university-art-museum-by-the-numbers,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-data-university-art-museum-by-the-numbers,"After nearly five years of renovations, the Princeton University Art Museum has reopened, showcasing more than 3,000 pieces from a collection of over 50,000. Featuring household names like Monet and Warhol alongside works from more obscure or even unidentified artists, the data reveals a varied curation across over 500 artists and 1,000 distinct artistic mediums in Princeton's newly renewed public art experience. The Daily Princetonian analyzed trends from the art museum collections database , focusing on the 3,241 artworks currently on display out of 58,348 total in the database. Where the data was consistently formatted, the 'Prince' used simple text-analysis machine learning (ML) techniques - word tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases) and clustering (grouping similar items based on shared features) - to organize the mediums and dates of works into broader categories. The art museum opened to the public on Halloween, drawing more than 20,000 visitors over a 24-hour opening event. Artists The 'Prince' first looked at a breakdown of credited artists on display at the art museum. Any art piece in the collections database whose artist description mentioned ""unknown"", ""attributed"", ""unrecorded"", or ""unidentified"" were removed for this analysis. There are 514 credited artists with works on display, 14 of which have more than four works on display. The artist with the most works on display is Eleanor Antin, mostly as part of a project called 100 Boots , which documents the staged travels of 100 pairs of black rubber boots. The project consists of 51 postcards of the boots photographed in a cross-country journey. The 'Prince' used the Bosworth Art score, a modification of the Bosworth score , to analyze how well-known artists are based on Google Trends data. The score compares an artist's number of monthly searches to Toshiko Takaezu, former Princeton art professor and creator of ""Dialogues in Clay,"" the welcome exhibit to the museum. Andy Warhol, Claude Monet, and Benjamin West hold the top three Bosworth Art scores, averaging roughly 84, 80, and 78 respectively for 2024. This means that each of these artists were searched about 80 times more often than Takaezu. By this metric, seven of the fifteen most recognizable artists are painters and four are photographers or print artists. Mediums The original dataset from the art museum's collection search included 1,084 different art mediums. To make these easier to study, the 'Prince' used a machine learning technique called k-means clustering to group similar mediums into broader categories to analyze. The original 1,084 medium entries were grouped into 40 broader categories, chosen using common data science methods to capture meaningful differences between mediums while keeping the categories simple enough to interpret. More than 240 works were categorized as either ""black-figure"" or general ceramics. Roughly one-quarter of these originated from Greek or Classical Greek culture, many representing black-figure pieces, which are bowls and vases decorated with ornamental motifs along the sides. Almost 99 percent of oil paintings, the second most frequently used medium, were not given a cultural label. Cultures There are 252 unique cultures on display at the art museum. Almost two thirds of works with labeled cultures had either East Asian, Mesoamerican, or Greek and Roman origins. 1,543 works had no culture label, usually indicating modern or contemporary art. Image Analysis The Museum's dataset contained 2,384 unique images. For each, the ""dominant color"" was found by averaging RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values across all pixels. k-means clustering was used to group these works into eight groups, with each sharing similar color profiles. Most of the works on display at the museum have muted color tones on average. About two thirds of all works have some shade of gray or beige as their average color - categorized into clusters representing the colors stone gray, ash brown, beige gray, and light sand. Golden tan, a smaller group of 253 works, has a yellow/gold average color, representing many of the images of clay sculptures. The smallest group, slate blue, is a blue-gray color and contains many of the more colorful and modern works on display at the museum. The 'Prince' also analyzed the relative brightness, saturation, and vibrance of works using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) codes. This was broken down by the ten most frequent cultural clusters, identified using k-means clustering. Most of the artistic cultural groups had similar brightness levels, with Roman works falling below the average by 5.3 percent and works in the Greek (other) category having 7.1 percent higher brightness levels than average. Olmec art, recognized for its stone sculptures and expressive human features, shows a 36.5 percent higher saturation than average. Etruscan art, known for its terracotta sculptures and ornate pottery , has a 15.3 percent higher saturation than average. In contrast, Japanese works, Egyptian works, and Non-Attic Greek works register about 10 percent lower saturation scores, suggesting subtler or more restrained palettes. Differences in vibrance values are more moderate, with Chinese, Roman, Japanese, Maya, Nasca, and Olmec artwork being close to average in value. Notably, Etruscan works have a vibrance value 17.5 percent higher than average, while Egyptian works have a value about 10 percent lower than average. The reopening marks an invitation to examine only a snippet of Princeton's collections. By the numbers, the museum's collection is vast and complex, hailing from many time periods and regions throughout human history. All visitors are able to visit the Princeton University Art Museum's collection of over 3,000 works for no cost. Vincent Etherton is a head Data editor for the 'Prince.'

How the new art museum confronts its 'problematic' past,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Features",Nikki Han,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:46:36 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-features-art-museum-renovation-layout,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-features-art-museum-renovation-layout,"Before its demolition in 2021, Director of the Princeton University Art Museum James Steward called the museum's layout ""problematic"" during a 2020 online presentation. European, American, and contemporary art dominated the main floor galleries, while non-Western art was relegated to the downstairs galleries. According to Steward's new book ""Renaissance: A New Museum for Princeton,"" around 40 percent of visitors to the art museum never went downstairs. ""It definitely imposed a sense of hierarchy,"" Michael Zhang GS '25, who recently completed a Ph.D. in African Art, told The Daily Princetonian. ""You felt this sense of grandeur when you walked in, and then you finished walking through the galleries on the first floor, and you had to go down to the basement where the African art and Asian art collection was."" ""People had to go downstairs, and it felt like a basement,"" Senior Associate Director for Collections and Exhibitions Chris Newth said earlier this semester during an early tour of the museum. The newly renovated museum tackles the problem of Eurocentricity head on, with an open layout to encourage visitor circulation between seven art pavilions, intentional juxtaposition of geographically and temporally disparate artworks, and placing artwork in the context it was first made to be viewed. But with the noticeable lack of a pavilion dedicated to African Art and uncertain provenance still haunting many non-Western pieces, questions remain over whether the new museum has been successful in its mission to ""challeng[e] the traditional hierarchies inherent in multilevel gallery display."" The old art museum When the old art museum was initially constructed in 1966, the gradual nature of its expansion produced a building which had hierarchy inscribed onto its very structure. It was only after renovations between 1986 and 1989 that the museum even installed a permanent African gallery in its lower level. According to a 1989 article in the 'Prince,' the art museum's newly expanded lower galleries housed ""collections of African, Far Eastern, Ancient and pre-Columbian art,"" with ""findings culled from Princeton University-sponsored archaeological digs in the Mediterranean and elsewhere."" Following the 1989 expansion, the art museum reopened in phases, with the lower floors and thus the non-Western art ""tak[ing] more time to organize,"" according to then-Director Allen Rosenbaum. The old museum, especially its non-Western galleries, faced what Steward described in his book as ""the challenge of 'threshold resistance,'"" the idea that a visitor's lack of preexisting knowledge or experience might make them feel uninvited and unwelcomed. ""It just seemed like [non-Western art] was an afterthought,"" Zhang said. The new museum promises to overcome this, with 95 percent of the galleries on the same level. A non-hierarchical layout In the new art museum, 31 out of the 32 galleries are housed on the second floor, which arranges separate pavilions and interstitial galleries in a cyclical design. The only gallery on the first floor houses temporary exhibitions. While pavilions largely separate the art geographically, the new museum's layout encourages movement across the museum. Art is displayed in all the transition spaces, creating a sense of fluidity, and walls that separate galleries within pavilions do not reach all the way to the ceiling, creating a sense of openness. In a statement to the 'Prince,' Asian Art curator Zoe S. Kwok described how the Asian pavilion is ""prominently positioned"" near the Grand Stair, and ""as such, many visitors will pass the Asian art pavilion."" ""You are naturally drawn into non-Western areas, right off the bat,"" Breton Langendorfer, Art & Archaeology Lecturer specializing in the ancient Middle East, told the 'Prince.' ""I think that the team have found incredible solutions in the beautifully fluid gallery spaces that reflect both difference and interconnectivity in space,"" Assistant Professor of Japanese Art History Rachel Saunders wrote in a statement to the 'Prince.' Still, the new art museum does not have a dedicated African art pavilion. African art is largely displayed in interstitial galleries, which a visitor encounters on the way to the Temporary Exhibitions pavilion on the second floor, currently displaying ""Princeton Collects."" Newth said that the floor space dedicated to African art galleries increased by around 700 percent from the previous building. The curation was overseen by Perrin Lathrop GS '21, who joined the art museum as its first permanent African art curator in 2022. While some have argued that the museum relegates African art to hallways, the art museum maintains that all gallery spaces are functionally similar, whether they are contained within a pavilion or not. ""We see no fundamental distinction between the character of our galleries and don't see any spaces in the building as 'hallways,'"" Museum Spokesperson Morgan Gengo wrote in a statement to the 'Prince.' Others agree. ""It felt to me like works by African artists are not just integrated, but really integral to the organization of the museum,"" Associate Professor of African American and Black Diasporic Art Anna Arabindan-Kesson added, but noted that she had only briefly visited the museum since its opening. Arabindan-Kesson suggested ""maybe some of those interstitial spaces are also ways to start to build those cross-historical and also aesthetic connections."" Zhang, however, argued that the lack of an African art pavilion suggests that the art ""is not receiving the same priority from the art museum as some of the other fields"" while acknowledging there is not ""necessarily a need to silo it in one pavilion."" Juxtapositions The new museum has positioned artworks to juxtapose their geographical, cultural, and temporal backgrounds. The European art pavilion, for example, contains a sculpture of ""Saint Peter Martyr"" (late 16th-early 17th century) from Mexico, which was originally thought to be Spanish and accordingly placed in the European collection, but recent research determined it was actually Mexican. ""It shows the transitory nature of artists,"" Newth said. The Orientation Gallery draws attention to the colonial legacy of historical figures like George Washington and former Princeton President Samuel Finley who were slaveowners, as well as the centrality of colonialism to the acquisition of pieces like a ""Nkisi"" from the early 20th century. Charles Wilson Peale's replica portrait of Washington (1787) is placed next to Titus Kaphar's ""To Be Sold"" (2018), depicting Finley with sale bills nailed onto his body to represent his ownership of enslaved people. Adjacent is the ""Nkisi,"" attributed to an unrecorded artist from what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ""The Orientation Gallery at the outset is really successful in putting forward these difficult questions that museums are grappling with right now - questions of provenance, questions of histories of colonialism, and a certain kind of Western chauvinism,"" Langendorfer said. Arabindan-Kesson points to the American art pavilion as another example of this. On display in the pavilion are casta paintings, originally from colonial Mexico, which are ""in conversation with works that would have come from the US,"" Arabindan-Kesson explained. ""Thinking about how these histories of colonial conquest and genocide and histories of race also become part of the aesthetic values that we understand to be art or art history is important,"" Arabindan-Kesson added. ""So I think those are really significant interventions."" Although the art museum makes these overt contrasts in time and place, art within pavilions is, for the most part, geographically self-contained. For Associate Professor of Japanese Literature Brian Steininger, this allows the museum to maintain its educational mission . ""They've had to strike a balance between this teaching museum objective, which tends to reinforce traditional categories,"" Steininger explained. ""But I think that there's also a lot of places … where the museum clearly is trying to find areas to allow for those kinds of unexpected juxtapositions."" Using the Asian art pavilion as an example, Steininger still praised the pavilions for being able to illuminate the ""interconnecting threads that lead between cultures within East Asia and then out to South Asia."" New approaches to installation Art museums in the West have faced criticism for their displays of non-Western pieces originally created for different, often non-public, purposes. ""Art from East Asia is often created for very different display contexts, contexts that are occasional, temporary, and largely private, so situating them comfortably and sensitively within the architecture of a 21st century public building in North America is also a huge challenge,"" Saunders wrote. The new art museum attempts to address these problems of display, within certain practical limits. A Guanyin sculpture, for example, is elevated to the height at which it would have been originally viewed. ""We tried to display [the Guanyin] in the way that it was meant to be experienced in its original context,"" Newth said, adding that ""we can't do that with everything, but there are moments when we can."" Steininger also gave the example of darkly lit Buddhist sculptures ""which then end up kind of looming at you out of the darkness, which is how you would encounter them in a temple."" ""The efforts the team have gone to in the creation of individualized and object-specific installation - some of it quite daring in the parlance of conventional museum practice in the US - is remarkable, and truly centers the objects to best advantage,"" Saunders wrote. Grappling with provenance The museum has also moved in recent years to more vigorously address provenance, the often-fraught history of an object's ownership beginning from its creation up until the present day. Although the art museum actively conducts provenance research, it can be difficult to determine the provenance of many pieces, especially those which were acquired decades or centuries ago. According to its website , objects are frequently bought and sold anonymously, past owners may have died, dealers sometimes do not disclose their sources, and records of dealers and auction houses can be incomplete. Consequently, works by unrecorded or unidentified artists commonly appear in the museum, particularly within non-Western art galleries. For artists whose names are unknown, labels designate them as ""Artist unrecorded"" which ""serves as a corrective to the ways that the international circulation of their work, especially during the colonial era, erased their individuality,"" according to Lathrop, given that the work was collected without the name of the maker. Langendorfer noted that, at least in his field of study, the ancient Middle East, ""it is historically common for specific artists or makers of objects to actually not be celebrated necessarily as individuals."" Moreover, on all the labels, the artwork's provenance is placed directly under the artist's name and the work's title. For Langendorfer, highlighting provenance in this way is an effective way to ""present this material ethically. Anything less would be an abdication of the obligations of having a collection like this, or the responsibilities of having a collection like this."" Zhang argued that the work is not yet done. ""It's work that can't be done in a vacuum,"" he said. ""It really necessitates larger dialogue and partnership and transparency."" Last year , the art museum appointed its first-ever provenance curator, MaryKate Cleary. In the last 20 years, Princeton has worked on repatriation efforts in addition to provenance research. This includes the return of eight looted objects to Italy in 2007 as well as ten artifacts being returned to Italy in 2023 , six of which were loaned to PUAM by Edoardo Almagià '73 , an art dealer who was charged last year for allegedly looting Italian antiquities after decades of investigation. The art museum has continuously been involved in conversations around repatriation that are ""ongoing,"" Arabindan-Kesson said. Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, for example, the museum has been ""working with Indigenous communities,"" she said. As a general principle, according to the art museum's website , ""the Museum seeks to meet and surpass both the requirements imposed by law and by cultural conventions and those required or requested by the museum field."" In both provenance and the arrangement of its collections, the new art museum has attempted to rectify the equity issues of its predecessor, although lingering concerns remain. ""The visitor is strongly encouraged to move from place to place, from time to time, and to make connections between objects from radically different times and places, to see all that material holistically, to see it all as part of humanistic expression,"" Langendorfer said.

New museum's Asian Art Pavilion undertakes a near-impossible task to mixed success,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Prospect, Arts",Kate Chun,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:44:21 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-asian-art-pavilion-undertakes-a-nearly-impossible-task-to-mixed-success,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-asian-art-pavilion-undertakes-a-nearly-impossible-task-to-mixed-success,"Showcasing artworks from Chinese handscrolls to Pakistani Buddhist figurines, the Asian Art Pavilion in the newly renovated Princeton University Art Museum undertakes a near-impossible task: representing the vastness of Asia in a room only slightly larger than a lecture hall. I entered the Pavilion with the expectation that the layout of the room would be by country - and my expectations were both met and broken. ""It's an incredibly difficult thing to bring together objects from the enormous spatial, temporal, and cultural reach of what we describe in one short word as 'Asia,'"" Professor of Japanese Art History Rachel Saunders wrote to The Daily Princetonian. As I entered, I immediately noticed that East Asian cultures were integrated into varying themes, such as 'Lacquered Objects.' This section featured lacquerware, a medium that originated in ancient China. With a collection spanning both time and geography, from the Chinese Eastern Zhou dynasty (771-256 BCE), the Japanese Edo period (1603-1868), and the Iranian Safavid dynasty (1501-1736), this art form highlighted the spread of Chinese influence across the continent, traced through a singular common medium. The Pavilion's South Asian and Southeast Asian pieces were isolated on the left side of the gallery, creating a feeling of division. As far as I could tell, the only representation of South and Southeast Asia comprised a small case featuring Buddhist sculptures and religious figurines from Cambodia, Pakistan, and India. Given that there is also a collection of Buddhist sculptures housed in a hallway outside of the pavilion, I felt the section lacked a variety in subject matter. While I expected to see secular items like household objects and ceramics, as I had seen in other parts of the gallery, the display was limited to religious items. As the back wall inside the left wing was dedicated to the Silk Road - thus featuring more Chinese art - a South Asian and Southeast Asian presence felt like an afterthought. The pavilion's curator, Zoe Kwok, is ""a Chinese specialist that is working with other colleagues to curate the entire collection, leading to people moving outside of their specialities,"" Yuchen Wang GS, a Ph.D. studentin the Art and Archaeology department, said. While the museum is only currently showing 5 percent of its whole collection , according to Wang, the Pavilion may begin to rotate through its pieces. However, there were also aspects of the pavilion I enjoyed. I appreciated its overall structure, which fluidly blended scrolls, vases, and paintings, holistically embodying the vibrant history of East Asia. Instead of the familiar cultural segmentation or chronological order that can constrain Asian history to Western stereotypes, the room's venture to interweave varying pieces - old and modern; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan -placing them in conversation with one another, showcased a more nuanced perspective. Even within the same culture, pieces interacted thoughtfully with one another. A case featuring Korean ceramics - including pieces such as a maebyeong, a Korean plum-shaped bottle from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392); an 18th-century porcelain jar; and ceramics by modern artist Young Sook Park - led me to compare the diverse styles throughout Korean history. On the right side of the pavilion, I was greeted by a fascinating contrast of Japanese prints. The layout guides viewers through the transition from the Edo period's woodblock prints of ordinary people to landscape images of bridges and gates, showcasing the impact of photography on Japanese art. Here, I could see the clash between modernity and the desire to hold onto traditional styles. I appreciated the pavilion's decision to include modern photographs. I also appreciated the pavilion's juxtaposition of two large scrolls at the center of the back of the room. One was a handscroll by one of the Four Great Masters of Song calligraphy, Huang Tingjian, the other a more modern 2010 woodcut scroll by Ji Yunfei. The former was an example of ""running script,"" while the latter depicted the Three Gorges Dam migration and its effects on millions of people. The calligraphy scroll was filled with elegant characters, a traditional Chinese art form seen across various media. On the other hand, Ji's scroll could be compared to a watercolor painting, with sketches of humans and natural scenes to tell a story not with words, but visceral images. I enjoyed how much the works emphasized the artist's role as a storyteller, their thoughts flowing out in different directions. ""[The Pavillon's curators] reshape ways of how people understand. Instead of telling a narrative, they are trying to engage the viewers to think. The Museum is a space for viewers in dialogue,"" Wang said.

Tired of Firestone? Try these study options at the Princeton University Art Museum,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Prospect, Arts",Kaichen Chou,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:44:00 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-tired-of-firestone-try-these-study-options-at-the-princeton-university-art-museum,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-tired-of-firestone-try-these-study-options-at-the-princeton-university-art-museum,"Why scroll through Instagram reels during sneaky study breaks when you can stroll through beautiful, refined exhibits to clear your head instead? Since the opening of the new Princeton University Art Museum on Halloween, I explored several of its spaces to identify study spots that could potentially top my go-to cubicles at Firestone - and maybe even yours. Grand Hall The Grand Hall, located past the art museum's gift shop on the first floor, is a vast and open space. There's plenty of seating, perfect for chatting with friends or taking a break from peering at exhibitions. Miniature chestnut-and-taupe couches, some back-to-back, are placed throughout the floor. The couches, along with several mustard yellow-and-orange-cushioned chairs, are paired with small, marbled coffee tables in front of them. Above, glass walls exhibit a portion of the museum's collection of ceramic trinkets, sculptures, and porcelain items on shelves. Natural lighting emanating from the gridded skylight ceiling illuminates the room in the daytime. At the front, a large projector display mostly remains black and dormant, but occasionally portrays graphics. While the environment is certainly relaxing, I would not consider Grand Hall an all-rounder study spot. Although the room is relatively spacious and offers comfortable seating options, you might be out of luck if you need a surface. The couches, while a good spot to write essays, are definitely not the space for you if you need a hard surface to physically write on. Not only are the coffee tables small, they are quite low - so you might risk a trip to Frist Health Center for back pain before finishing your p-set. The Grand Hall works if you prefer a semi-busy atmosphere and do not need a table to work on. Outdoor Pavilion In my search for a better study space, I headed outside, where I was greeted with a series of green metal tables and chairs below the museum's northwest cantilever. Along the edge, patio umbrellas shield the tables from harsh sunlight, adding a nice touch to the area's overall appearance. While the chairs were slightly wobbly and are not the most comfortable to sit in - especially compared to the lush and full seating inside Grand Hall - the circular tables provided ample surface area to work on. With a gorgeous autumn view of fall leaves and cycling students, studying felt relaxing and unrestrictive and provided a great change of scenery from the usual blank walls of Firestone's basement. I also appreciated the ability to glance ahead and see the hustle and bustle of each passerby which made the space feel more lively and motivating. While the pavilion area is an amazing choice for folks who desire fresh air while studying, it is worth noting that the outdoors may become a less practical option as we quickly approach winter with earlier sunsets. To this point, as I studied, the wind grew progressively more frigid, and the sunset at 5 p.m. cut my session short. For this reason, to maximize your study experience outside the art museum, take advantage of the warmer and sunnier daylight hours. Once spring rolls around, though, I can imagine the pavilion area being a reliable, productive location for me as well as many others. Mosaic Restaurant As soon as I walked into the restaurant, located on the third floor of the museum, I was greeted by soft, natural lighting that permeated the room through translucent ivory curtains. The golden hour sun enveloped the room in rays of sunshine, creating a cozy environment ideal for work. At the front, a multi-colored tiled mosaic, paying homage to the restaurant's name, contributed to the room's luxurious essence. Brown square dining tables fill the space, topped with glass vases holding foliage. Beneath the curtains, a dining table spanning the wall stood out to me as an ideal spot to study. The large glass windows ahead offered a beautiful view of Dod Hall and other nearby buildings. If you get hungry, Mosaic's comprehensive menu offers a wide range of options, from desserts and baked goods to coffee, tea, and other beverages. While the prices of the main courses on their menu are steep, their desserts are quite reasonably priced and could serve as a convenient and affordable source of energy during long study sessions. Although Mosaic appears to cater more to visitors than students due to some of its higher-end prices, the atmosphere is still comparable to that of any typical coffee shop, making it an optimal setting for getting work done. However, Mosaic closes at 3 p.m. on most weekdays and the weekend, and is closed completely from Tuesday to Wednesday - so be sure to keep an eye out for available times during your next study session. In all, although the art museum provides enjoyable views and comfortable spaces, I still prefer Firestone for urgent assignments and longer study sessions. That being said, the new museum spaces offer a change in scenery that I, as well as many other students, will appreciate in the waning weeks of the fall semester.

'Europe is and has long been a crossroads': the European Art pavilion's new perspective on a global continent,"Top Stories, top-story, review, Prospect, life-culture, Arts, Princeton University Art Museum",Devon Williams,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:43:44 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-europe-long-been-crossroads-european-art-pavilion-new-perspect-global-europe,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-europe-long-been-crossroads-european-art-pavilion-new-perspect-global-europe,"As I first stepped into the European Art pavilion, I found myself surrounded by color: maroon, gold, and blue hues covered the walls as ceramics, paintings, and prints from diverse eras, artists, and regions converged. Yet the pavilion goes beyond unifying an eclectic color palette - it also offers a powerful message on cultural intersection. One of the works I was most moved by was the renowned Alfred Stevens painting, ""The Psyché (My Studio)."" Its intricately painted refined art studio space, with the delicate woman peeking from behind the mirror to meet my eye in the reflection drawing me over for a closer look, strikingly contrasts a painting by the lesser known Berta Wetman's ""Interior."" Wetman's painting mirrors the subject matter and perspective of Stevens' work, but with a grittier, simpler beauty absent of a female muse. The curatorial choice of creating conversations between known and less-known artists complemented one another, encouraging me to learn more about every piece. The pairings brought pieces unfamiliar to me to the forefront, expanding the context and meaning of the piece alone into one that encompasses the works on the walls surrounding it and the pavilion itself. Even the corridor that flanks the pavilion's entrance highlights pieces of seemingly non-European origin. Three central objects dominate the corridor: the Incan Cup of Montezuma brought to Spain in the 17th century, an Indian ewer made for the British Empire, and a West African ivory spoon brought to Portugal. According to Associate Curator Alexandra Letvin, the pieces are ""not European, but that circulated in Europe."" While this may appear strange, Letvin says this choice was intentional: ""objects that circulated in Europe had a European provenance unintentionally, or were intentionally made for European audiences."" Letvin added that she aimed to ""show Europe looking outwards, not just looking inwards."" ""Europe is and has long been a crossroads - a diverse continent with many cultural traditions,"" said Annemarie Ike GS '23, Lecturer in the Princeton Writing Program and Art History Ph.D.. Display of European art has often centered on white, traditional voices while obscuring the diverse and complex nature of populations colonized and integrated. Yet the new openness and interdisciplinary nature of the museum help convey this reality, as a metaphor for the continent itself: porous, dynamic, and in constant exchange. In the University's old art museum, European art dominated the main level, leaving little room for art of other cultures. The new museum equalizes this space, with each pavilion sharing roughly the same footprint, and an open floorplan that allows each room to flow into the other. As I walked through and inevitably got lost, this openness and exchange between cultures and histories certainly came through in proximity between diverse pieces alone. ""The collection is laid out more or less chronologically and geographically,"" Letvin explains. The Art Museum has long been a teaching center for professors and students in the Art History department, and Letvin has intentionally maintained this teachability by keeping content in thematic groupings in addition to chronological organization. To achieve this fluidity, Letvin outlined three driving points, beginning with, ""Europe's place within a global world,"" she explained. Works from India, Africa, and more find a home directly in the pavilion, creating a new and complex vision of Europe and its relationship with other countries. ""I like to push back on the term masterpiece. And so one thing that we started using when we were thinking about these galleries, but really the whole museum was the idea of anchor objects,"" Letvin said. Anchor objects are used to engage other works to generate new interpretations of the work. Examples range from Gérôme's ""Napoleon in Egypt"" and Monet's ""Water Lilies"" to works by unknown artists. The well-known works are recognizable but don't dominate - they contextualize and inform the works that may be more obscure. This representation of lesser-known works and works across cultures even lends itself to the more famous pieces like Manet's Woman with a Cigarette, which, as Iker noted, ""because of the uncertainties about the identity of its subject, seems to be at home in a new way in the new [pavilion]."" Exploring the pavilion's four galleries, the works seemed to flow into one another, a woven tapestry of intersecting media, cultures, and time periods. The contrast between these artistic factors and origins kept me curious about every piece and its place in the world, and that curiosity could have kept me walking around for hours. This ambitious philosophy of centering non-European art is realized through Letvin's choice to host a case of works in the central corridor of the pavilion as opposed to a single ""important painting."" The case of works highlights the ""circulation of commodities throughout Europe and so, in a sense, becomes a more personal reflection of the stories that these three objects are telling."" This recenters high art on a personal level, a theme that aids the sense of an interconnected global community on an intimate scale while simultaneously rewriting what defines 'European art.' Many visitors come to museums seeking the most famous pieces, but in doing so, they miss the chance to truly learn from what they are experiencing. In choosing pieces that are less well known or unconventionally European, visitors can expand their idea of what art is worthy of witnessing. Through this focus on exchange in geography, layout, and media, Letvin leaves visitors with a clear message: ""I hope that they leave the pavilion thinking that Europe is more connected to the world around it, and I also hope that they will see that Europe's boundaries shift over time ... I hope that people understand [the Art Museum] as a place within a connected world."" Devon Williams is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2028.

Transcending dimension: PUAM showcases photography through Peter Bunnell's objects,"Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Prospect, Princeton University Art Museum",Michael Grasso,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:43:03 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-transcending-dimension-art-museum-showcases-photography-objects-peter-bunnell,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-transcending-dimension-art-museum-showcases-photography-objects-peter-bunnell,"What does a photograph look like? Is it just a picture pasted on a wall, or is it something you can hold and move with? Maybe, according to Peter Bunnell, it's all of the above. This is the question the Princeton University Art Museum (PUAM) wrestles with in its first photography exhibit. The idea comes from Bunnell, a legend in the history of photography and the first endowed professor of photography history in the U.S. His quote, ""What Photographs Look Like,"" is the core theme of the gallery. The description on the wall reads, ""Bunnell used the phrase to upend his students' expectations of photographs as strictly two dimensional prints and to invite delight in the expansive nature of the medium."" I took a walk through the gallery to determine if it effectively conveys this theme of transcendence through medium and surprise. The pavilion has only one way in: a confrontation with Narcissus. The colossal piece that characterizes the gallery, Vik Muniz's Narcissus from his series ""Pictures of Junk,"" towers over its onlookers. Due to its size, it completely blocks the viewers from seeing the rest of the gallery; one must travel around Narcissus in order to see the rest. Playing with perspective and distance, Narcissus delights from afar with its reproduction of the 16th century painting by Caravaggio. Its magnificence reveals itself by looking closer and seeing that it is entirely composed of pieces of trash, arranged by Muniz's assistants. Not just a photograph, but a living piece of artwork and sculpture, Narcissus encapsulates the idea of surpassing the medium of photography and entering other worlds. This makes it an apt choice to begin the viewer's experience of this gallery. ""I think it's fantastic. I think it manages to pack an encyclopedic history of photography into an intimate space,"" saidMonica Bravo, an assistant professor of art and archaeology who specializes in the history of photography and modern art in the Americas. Bunnell's legacy is celebrated with a display of his personal collection of ""What Photographs Look Like,"" which includes objects like magazines, postcards, and even an albumen print of Nassau Hall. Bravo told the 'Prince' this collection of Bunnell's provides ""a range of different photographic processes as well as formats, and any idea of photography in an expanded field too."" This collection surpasses the two dimensions that often constrict photography, and there are plenty of videos featured next to images around the gallery. Bravo expressed how she thought the two could be mixed, saying, ""I actually always believe that photography should be taught in relation to other media because photography exists in a larger visual ecosystem. So for me, it was very effective to see photography placed next to video."" However, one piece fits awkwardly amid the rest. Wu Tsang's Miss Communication and Mr:Re is a two-channel film, presented by two video screens parallel to each other. Mounted on the back of a dividing wall, Tsang's film is accompanied by two speakers projecting separate voicemail messages of the subjects shown on screen. They look directly at the camera, expressionless. Although video and photography work in relation to each other, this piece interacts oddly with its environment. The two voices are muffled in the noise of the other, and the flat facial expressions provide little to no enrichment when regarding for more than a couple seconds. It lacks congruency with the rest of the gallery due to its awkward placement, facing Bunnell's collections and mounted on a faux-wall. A little forgettable - and more experimental than the rest - Miss Communication and Mr:Re transcends the realm of photography solely by being a film, not as an interesting merge of the two art forms. Besides that piece, the gallery comes together cohesively. The multitudes of black and white filling the walls mask subversive elements of the artwork. One may wonder why a drawing finds itself in the photography gallery, but Sir John Herschel's ""Castle of Chillon"" camera lucida drawing evokes the beginnings of the art form. The camera lucida was an optical device invented to superimpose an image of a certain object on a canvas, allowing for smooth tracing. Paired with the history of photography, Bunnell's legacy is at the forefront of this first exhibition. Bunnell died in September 2021, just mere months after the old art museum was demolished. People familiar with the history of photography will likely be familiar with his impact, and the importance of his centrality in the exhibit. However, if this is someone's first entrance into photography, they may not understand the emphasis. That does not mean they will not learn from him, as Bunnell was, above all, a teacher. His teaching persists in PUAM's photography gallery, as the photographs, photo sculptures, camera lucidas, and more show ""what photographs look like.""

"Despite crowded central displays, the Ancient Americas pavilion gives some works space to breathe","Top Stories, news, top-story, homepage, Princeton University Art Museum",Cynthia Torres,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:41:46 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-art-museum-pavilion-review-ancient-americas,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-art-museum-pavilion-review-ancient-americas,"In theArt of the Ancient Americas pavilion at the new Princeton University Art Museum, the first thing one notices is the crowded, dense displays in glass cases wrapping around the museum's central Grand Hall. But while plates are next to plates and vases next to vases, the dense displays appear less important than the thoughtfully displayed objects found in the rest of the pavilion that are given appropriate space, sometimes with 360 degrees of viewing. ""The Princeton Vase ,"" one of the museum's most iconic pieces, has its own dedicated case in the pavilion. A Mayan chocolate-drinking cup inscribed in codex style, the vase presents a story depicting human sacrifice, calling upon the viewer to continually rotate around the vase and reveal the story told through rich iconography. The pavilion also features several other Mayan drinking cups, called uk'ibs, with inscribed images and a story told by rotating the vase. Some other Mayan drinking cups tell more pivotal stories for Mayan history. One uk'ib depicts the story of the infamous defeat of major underworld Gods, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, and another tells the story of the annual cycle of rebirth of the maize god, Hun Hunahpu. The displayed uk'ibs date back to the second half of the first millennium. Outside of ceramic vases and plates, ceramic figures are on display throughout the pavilion. The Jaina figurines were particularly eye-catching, displayed in a line directly at eye level with their earth tones contrasting with the navy blue wall behind them. The Jaina figurines were from 600-900 A.D. and associated with the islands of Jaina and Uaymil off the west coast of Mexico. Each of the figures represented different noble Mayans with various court positions and genders. The didactic explains that these figurines were often unearthed by looters and presumably associated with burials. Museum visitors Kruti Ramani and Sabrina Yanetta described the collection as ""very expansive."" ""There's so much to see, to look at. You see it once, and then you walk around the second time you see stuff you didn't see the first time,"" Yanetta said, describing the circles she walked in the relatively small gallery. Representing over 5,000 years of art crafted by indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, the collection varied across many empires across the North and South American continents. Another compelling aspect of the Ancient Americas pavilion was the small study cases, something not available in most other pavilions in the museum. Featuring objects smaller than an inch long, the study tables provide a space in the center of the museum to examine individual objects. Artifacts include a series of metal figures and ornaments from Qhapaq Hucha, an important sacrificial site for subjects of the Inca Empire. Metal headdress ornaments and chest plates from Peru during the first millennium are also available for close study. The Art of the Ancient Americans pavilion is not ancient in any way. The pavilion is modern and thoughtfully juxtaposes the centuries-old artwork with a sleek design, breathing in new life and appreciation to previously forgotten art.

"PUAM's Ancient Mediterranean Pavilion steps into the past, with a modern twist","Top Stories, top-story, homepage, Prospect, Arts, Princeton University Art Museum",Zane Mills VanWicklen,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:41:22 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-art-museum-mediterranean-ceramics-statues-gallery,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-arts-art-museum-mediterranean-ceramics-statues-gallery,"In the Princeton University Art Museum's Ancient Mediterranean pavilion, each step carries you across centuries and civilizations. Entering the pavilion, you tread upon a glass floor, beneath which lies a mosaic pavement once used as flooring in an elite villa in the ancient city of Antioch, now modern-day Turkey. You then pass a mixing bowl from the 4th century B.C.E. in southern Italy, featuring rich shades of black, orange, and white, which create stark contrasts and dazzling designs. Across from this, you see another vessel with art of a similar style; yet, rather than depicting a Greek god or a Roman emperor, it depicts modern city streets, telephone poles, and graffiti. This is the work of Roberto Lugo , a modern ceramicist who takes inspiration from ancient Greek art for his modern day works. In an interview with The Daily Princetonian, Associate Curator of Ancient Mediterranean Art Carolyn Laferrière calls this contrast another one of the ""surprising juxtapositions"" the pavilion presents to museum visitors. Through this decision, she hopes to inspire ""curiosity,"" inviting people to ask ""questions or … rethink assumptions."" Laferrière also says that, in the Ancient Mediterranean, art was used to tell stories. In Lugo's vase, one continues to see how ""art is a really powerful vehicle for telling the stories of your community and of people who did extraordinary things."" Visitors are asked not to simply glance at a wall of ceramics but rather delve into the details of each piece, to ask how the works were made in the ancient world and how they are made today. Echoing this point, art and archeology professor John Sigmier says these surprising juxtapositions ""make the past seem not so alien."" While the objects in the pavilion may appear ""strange"" at first, their pairing with a contemporary piece of a similar visual idiom allows visitors to view depictions of life in the ancient world as they would those of life in the 21st century. The pavilion puts pieces that span great gaps in time and space in conversation with one another, seeking to accomplish the museum's goal of promoting ""dialogue among diverse audiences, foster[ing] inquiry and curiosity, and afford[ing] encounters that excite the imagination,"" as stated in its mission statement . Sigmier said that the space achieves this goal and that he plans to bring the students in his courses to the pavilion and say to them, ""Here's what we're talking about."" The pavilion situates itself within a larger global community. Laferrière chose pieces from the ancient civilizations of ""Near East, Egypt, Greece, Italy, and the Roman and Byzantine Empires,"" to reveal that objects, people, and ideas moved across the Ancient Mediterranean; each piece is placed in conversation with one another. A visitor walking past various sculptures of Aphrodite from different time periods and places experiences the similarities between the pieces and the inspirations the ancient peoples took from one another. One fascinating element of the pavilion is that these pieces not only tell ancient stories but also give insight into modern geopolitical relationships. For example, former art and archeology professor Ernest DeWald Class of 1916 GS discovered that a marble head of a goat on display in the old art museum had been stolen from the Capitoline Museums in Rome during World War II. After learning this, the museum returned the piece to its rightful owners in 1953 . According to Lafèrriere, Italy was so grateful for the gesture and, knowing it to be a favorite of the students, returned it to Princeton. Beside the piece is a photo of the ceremony in which it was bestowed upon the University. These works thus span great gaps both in time and space. The visitor, in perusing the pieces, travels these distances with single steps, one moment examining a vase from fourth century B.C.E. Greece and another a fragmented statue from second century C.E. Rome. In organizing the pieces, Laferrière aimed to highlight the ""range of lived experience that was available in the ancient world."" Each of the works holds a story. Whether in ""surprising juxtapositions"" or clear pairings, the artwork whispers tales of war, love, ritual, and everyday life to its visitors. The pavilion presents these works in all their uniqueness and splendor, telling a story not just of the diversity of these civilizations and the connections to modernity but of a world in which we are all connected, where we are inspired by one another to bring forth newness and originality. Laferrière wants visitors to leave with a sense of ""curiosity"" and ""to think through some of the questions that the ancient objects are asking of themselves,"" for many of them we continue to ponder today.

PUAM's Modern and Contemporary Art Pavilion contrasts cultures and textures,"Top Stories, news, top-story, homepage",Lulu Mangriotis,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:40:31 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-art-museum-pavilion-review-modern-and-contemporary,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-university-art-museum-pavilion-review-modern-and-contemporary,"The Princeton University Art Museum's Modern and Contemporary Art Pavilion, curated by Alexandra Foradas, spans textures, mediums, and styles, with the viewer seeing a new juxtaposition of pieces no matter where they stand. The pavilion starts strong with Jean-Michel Basquiat's ""Notary"" (1983) at the entryway. In this piece, and many of his others, Basquiat does not erase his work, instead letting the viewer in on his creative process. He crosses out words or letters just to later rewrite them, blurring the lines between draft and final product. The pavilion's walls do not reach the ceiling, lending an openness to the walk and encouraging viewers to look out across the gallery, where they will be greeted by a lively horizon at nearly any angle. In many places, it is possible to look through doorways to see large slices of the gallery, hosting a collection of radically different and curious pieces that draw you further in. The collection boasts another Basquiat, a Yayoi Kusama painting, and multiple Willem de Kooning works. Further into the exhibit, different textures permeate the walls in a simple yet striking way. A frameless canvas with crumpled paper, glitter, sequins, and strings covered in acrylic paint - an untitled piece by Howardena Doreen Pindell (1977) - provides a range of textures in a contemporary medium. Pindell was ahead of her time - much of her art is similar to contemporary works. She used a hole punch to draw the viewer's eye to specific points of light and color, according to the piece's didactic. More typical works from the 1970s might include Andy Warhol's bold striking prints and colors, but Pindell subverts this preconception with its simplistic and ""undone"" characteristics. Foradas's predecessor, Kelly Baum, started the curation for the pavilion, prioritizing the way pieces interact when choosing artworks and positions. ""My predecessor and colleagues chose and juxtaposed objects in ways that encourage the viewer to consider the impact of cultural contact and exchange,"" Foradas wrote to The Daily Princetonian. Whether steeped in meaning or entirely meaningless, the art in the pavilion has been organized to foster curiosity and inspire. The gallery juxtaposes Sanford Bigger's ""Tunic"" (2003), a feathered puffer coat, with Elias Sime's ""TIGHTROPE: ECHO?!"" a rectangular sculpture made of reclaimed electrical wire and components. The aesthetic contrast of these two pieces in such proximity reminds the viewer of how conventional artistic boundaries are broken by contemporary artists. The sharpness of ""TIGHTROPE: ECHO?!"" stands out against the colored feathers of Bigger's work. Perhaps the most charming part of the pavilion is the Hans & Donna Sternberg Viewing Room attached in the northeastern-most corner of the art museum. There, the viewer leaves the layered views of textured contemporary art and finds a single work: Jane Irish's ""Cosmos Beyond Atrocity"" (2024), embedded in the ceiling. The captivating piece was commissioned for this specific room of the art museum, making for a cohesive viewing experience. While a mesmerizing distortion of angles and pastel colors warp the viewer's perspective, an arm emerges from the sky and reaches towards them. ""The Museum was keen to work with a regionally based artist committed to the continuing vitality of painting; we were thrilled that Jane was so keen to mine the collections for inspiration and to draw on the past,"" Museum Director James Steward said in a statement. The new viewing room was adapted in modern style from a similar room in the old art museum. ""The other viewing room felt a little bit more like a living space with a restful feeling,"" said Princeton resident Matthew Feuer. ""[The new viewing room] is more integrated into the museum."" However, Feuer noted that there were clear resemblances between the two: both featured identical circular windows and were surrounded by trees, including the dawn redwood marking the eastern-most point the new museum reaches. Feuer also noted that the old room didn't have any art - it was only a domestic escape from the rest of the museum. ""[The old room] was charming, but it was nothing like this,"" Feuer said. The new Sternberg Viewing Room coaxes the viewer into meditation, providing a haven of natural and artistic surroundings. The pavilion as a whole will be ever-changing, as the museum will periodically update the modern art displayed. Foradas has spoken with students and professors alike to gauge what the Princeton community looks for in contemporary art. ""A few key themes emerge: landscapes and borders, activism and liberation, ways of (hi)storytelling, questioning abstraction, and the relationship between art and performance and other types of liveness,"" according to Foradas. In the meantime, there is much art in which to indulge. This pavilion is sure to have something grab your attention, either with an eye-opening piece or a striking view across many.

Goheen Professor in the Humanities, wrote the memoir in the year after her younger son, James, died by suicide as a first-year at Princeton, and is publishing it eight years after her older son, Vincent, died by suicide as a sophomore at Princeton High School. The book has been well-received by critics and is a finalist for the nonfiction category in this year's National Book Awards. Even before I read it, the book held a special interest for me: I was James's classmate in high school, where we were both on the fencing team. I wasn't a close friend but knew many who were. When I interviewed many of them last year for James' obituary in our pages, they all talked about his kindness and reliability and humor, but they also talked abouthow quiet and enigmatic he was. The portrait of James we created always felt incomplete, so part of me wondered if reading this book could help me understand a person so mysterious in life. Yet Li, too, often found James enigmatic in life. She writes about how Vincent, her older son, was flamboyant and captured people's attention; James, on the other hand, turned away from notice. Much of James is explained in relation to his older brother, as if he remains too elusive to be defined independently. ""Vincent lived feelingly, James lived thinkingly,"" she writes. Li dreaded Vincent's suicide long before it happened, but James' choice stunned her. Earlier parts of the book are dominated by descriptions of Vincent, which initially surprised me - but an attempt to understand James is impossible without understanding others around him, she writes. This is particularly true of his brother, who may have been the only person to truly understand James, despite their differences. In death, James remains enigmatic -Li acknowledges throughout the book that writing in a way that is true to who James was is no easy task, and both her answers and her questions may miss the truth. Li explains early on that she tried to orient this book not around feelings, but logic, reflecting James's personality. In this, she succeeds - the close analysis gives rise to a philosophy of life fractured by deaths, a topography of loss. Li writes from an ""abyss,"" or what a friend of hers describes as a ""space outside place."" This abyss, this place she is unable to remove herself from, is a radical acceptance - no denials, few what-ifs -of the fact that her life will never again be all right. Death is like a point in a timeline, while the sorrow in life after death has no endpoint. It's ideas like these that make the book different from many other works on loss, and it's also what may make the book difficult to process for readers who believe there is no logic after loss. But for readers who can suspend judgement and allow themselves to be swept away by Li's writing, this book is well-worth the read. The structure of the work, however, is where Li's ability as a writer shines. Her sentences can travel a few minutes or several years in the same paragraph. Motifs and ideas are always consequential, and Li bends phrases to create surprising meanings. ""To philosophize is to learn to die,"" from Montaigne, temporarily becomes, ""to philosophize is to learn to live with deaths."" Reality and unreality, life and death, mother and son, are pairs described as two hands placed close to each other, with fingers just touching or intertwined. Parents can hold their children's hands through some of life, but Li recognizes that parents cannot protect their children from everything. Even though she is a better mother than her mother, and her husband a better father than his own, both of her children chose - and she is particular about this word - to exit the world. ""Both my children chose a hard thing. We are left with the hardest: to live after their deaths."" What is to be done in the face of helplessness? How do parents live after their children die? There are some answers: for instance, Li recounts how she chose to ""do things that work,"" an idea she remembered from psychologist Marsha Linehan. Yet most of the answers are hard to find, and the questions harder to ask. Despite the serious and sad questions the book tackles, the slim volume -just 172 pages -is largely absent of melodrama. Li's prose in this memoir, as in her fiction, is precise and sharp. Adjectives and adverbs are used sparingly. Short sentences are stark and painful. ""Thinking about my children is like air, like time. Thinking about them will only end when I reach the end of my life."" But there are some moments that brought up strong emotions in me; I felt disbelief at the callousness of strangers and ex-friends. Li details how one writer used the news of James's death as an opportunity to introduce himself and ask for referrals to a publisher. In these moments, Li's writing can border on darkly funny. (She directly addresses a parent who tries to impress her with the gesture of his daughter's violin-playing: ""I am a bereaved mother who happens to teach at an Ivy League university; I don't work for the admissions office."") This work lingers less on the ""why"" of the deaths of her two children, although in a few instances, Li writes about the what-ifs, the what-could-have-beens. Each time, however, she catches herself and edits - or, to use a word she prefers, pressures - her thoughts to display rigor and respect for language and narrative. Alternatives, she writes, are fiction. Other than a correction of her own thoughts, it seems that she is also admonishing members of the public who read more into her son's deaths than anyone can understand - she dedicates several pages to American and Chinese newspapers and tabloids who were all too happy to revel in her tragedy. Nowhere is this caution against interpretation clearer than in the title, which comes from a phrase Li thinks of when she gardens, a hobby she began a few years ago. Things in nature have no ""metaphorical or symbolic meaning beyond nature's mere way of being."" Things in nature live, and they die. And those of us who lose will continue living, until we die as well. Christopher Bao is a senior News writer for the 'Prince.' He is from Princeton, N.J. and typically covers town politics and life.

Linguistics students and faculty react to new program independence,"Top Stories, news, top-story, academics, homepage",Isaac Bernstein,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:54:00 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-linguistics-launches-independent-program-in-linguistics-react,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-linguistics-launches-independent-program-in-linguistics-react,"At a Nov. 3 faculty meeting, faculty voted unanimously to declare the Program in Linguistics an independent academic unit. The change moves the program out of the Council of the Humanities, and into the Social Sciences Academic Division. With the move, the program gains the autonomy to hire new faculty and now has an independent financial chartstring. Although the program is not yet an official department, current Linguistics faculty and independent majors celebrated the step forward. ""This is an extremely exciting moment for the Program in Linguistics, one we have been working towards for many years!"" wrote Associate Professor Laura Kalin in a statement to The Daily Princetonian. Kalin also serves as the associate director of the Program in Linguistics. ""Really the only change was we would have to change the logo on our merch: we can't use the humanities logo anymore,"" said Linguistics concentrator Ellie Noland '27. Kalin, along with then-director Adam Elga, proposed this change back in Nov. 2023 in a memo to the Academic Planning Group. Kalin hopes to establish an official major in linguistics next, as those intending to major in linguistics are currently required to complete an independent major application. ""We are thrilled to have the support of university leadership and the university community for our independence as an academic unit in the social sciences, a move which aligns with our current research methodologies and course offerings as well as our planned future path for growth,"" Kalin wrote. Jordan Chi '28, a prospective math major who considered a linguistics major, told the 'Prince,' ""It makes sense [that] they're shying away from the humanities label."" ""Linguistics is very broad and interdisciplinary,"" he added. ""I think a lot of what linguists are doing is very computational in nature."" For students who have declared the independent major in Linguistics, the shift is welcome, but not significant. ""I hadn't heard anything about the change. But since I only have a year and a half left, I don't think it will affect me much,"" Cueyoung Lee '27 said. Still, Kalin stressed its positive influence on the program as a whole. ""The move also coincides with our welcoming a new faculty member this spring,"" she added. Although linguistics exists as an established department at peer institutions like Harvard and Yale , Princeton remains without one. On this issue, Lee emphasized, ""[F]unding is crucial for the Linguistics Program to take the steps it needs to become a full department."" Haeon Lee is a News contributor for the 'Prince.'

"NJ AI Hub chosen for new Microsoft AI platform rollout, one of two locations worldwide","Top Stories, news, top-story, homepage, research",Luke Grippo,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:47:53 -0500",https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-research-nj-ai-hub-microsoft-discovery-platform-rollout,https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-research-nj-ai-hub-microsoft-discovery-platform-rollout,"After six months of internal pre-work, Microsoft will be launching a new, supercharged generative AI platform for researchers - and the New Jersey AI Hub will be one of two locations to trial it. This new platform is called Microsoft Discovery - ""A ChatGPT for scientists,"" as Liat Krawczyk, Executive Director of the NJ AI Hub, told The Daily Princetonian. ""We are one of two sites in the world selected to have access to the platform before it's released, and it's really exciting,"" Krawczyk said. The program will serve as a backbone for researchers, enabling faster and more sophisticated analysis capabilities and increased data computation, according to Krawczyk and Marie Pryor, Community Manager for Microsoft's TechSpark NJ. University researchers will be among the first to have the opportunity to use it, contingent on their engagement with the AI Hub. There are high hopes. With Discovery, researchers will be able to ""take on problems that maybe to this point have been too complex to be entertained, to be researched, to be touched,"" Pryor wrote. Krawczyk also said that the program will be able to analyze data that would otherwise ""take humans a very long time"" because of the scale of the datasets and the complexity of the processes required to analyze it. This new platform was launched in private preview in May, two months after the opening of the NJ AI Hub, located on Route 1. Princeton University and Microsoft are two of the founding partners of the AI Hub, joined by AI computing company Coreweave and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority . After testing Discovery in Microsoft labs throughout the summer, and already yielding breakthroughs, such as a ""novel sustainable coolant prototype for datacenter immersion cooling,"" Microsoft is leaning into the University to continue pioneering breakthroughs with the new technology, Pryor wrote. ""It goes without saying Princeton has global prestige,"" Pryor told the 'Prince' in an interview. ""When you're looking for top tier research, look no further in many cases, and so [Princeton] was an easy and obvious early partner to lean in with."" Princeton and the NJ AI Hub will not be the only location for this new AI software. TitletownTech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was selected as the second location where Discovery will be simultaneously launched. Pryor said that she and her counterpart at Titletown serve as the ""connective tissue"" between the two locations - a connection that is expected to surge once the program has been actively launched. ""The rollouts will be on par with one another,"" Pryor said. ""Down the line, once it's actively running, there would be shared learning, shared collaboration, perhaps even shared expertise across the two locations."" Both locations were chosen as fountainheads for Discovery because of ""the uniqueness of the [local] industry clusters,"" Pryor explained. For New Jersey, these are the ones situated along the Route 1 corridor . While both locations are pursuing similar goals of innovation, they differ in the type of industry they are promoting. Emphasizing that there is not a ""hard split"" between the two, Pryor explained that Microsoft is leaning towards New Jersey primarily for pharmaceutical, life sciences, and health industry-focused research, while leaning towards Wisconsin for the material sciences and manufacturing industry. Both locations, however, are set to be crucial in ""discovering new materials, new drugs, new cures, new treatments at record pace,"" Pryor said. The process to be chosen for Discovery access will be selective, according to Krawczyk. She explained that ""the use cases that will be selected are the ones for which the platform is most ripe to help them"" - cases that ""make sense for the platform."" Both Pyror and Krawczyk emphasized finding what Pyror called the ""right stakeholders"" and what Krawczyk called ""trustworthy partners."" ""What criteria - what does that look like? What type of elements would be a desirable, successful project? Who has to be at the table? The readiness of the entities that we're engaging with?"" Pryor told the 'Prince,' regarding what factors were important in considering access to Discovery - or, as she put it, making a ""match"" with the proper industry partner. ""Assume that 100 percent of chemists have expertise in chemistry - maybe two percent of chemists are computational chemists,"" Krawczyk added. ""The question is: Can we take someone with deep expertise in their own domain and lend them computational capabilities and large data kinds of conclusions that would accelerate their research?"" Currently, Discovery seems more oriented towards larger, group-led projects. While Pyror emphasized that a ""substantive"" enough individually-led project would be considered for Discovery access, the program will primarily be concerned with adhering to the ""collective brain trust"" in New Jersey and ""trying to bring the right groups, small groups, but the right groups of people together."" Krawczyk added that she hopes the program includes not just ""the Princeton community, but also other higher education communities everywhere, from students to faculty who are interested in AI"" - communities that the AI Hub is ""certainly open to partnerships"" with, ""to the extent that they make sense for [Discovery]."" Pryor also said that Microsoft hopes both the NJ AI Hub and Titletown will become ""models that will draw other people to these locations, to be able to access this type of ecosystem for this level of scientific advancement."" The rollout of Discovery is expected in the coming months. There are no current plans for extension to other locations, according to Pryor.

It is located in West Windsor, not in Princeton as was previously stated. It has also been edited to clarify that Microsoft Discovery is a platform, rather than a model, because of its capacity to host different AImodels and agents. The 'Prince' regrets these errors.",
