Food insecure students weather SNAP disruptions following government shutdown ,"University, News, FLISSC, Food, food accessibility, Food Insecurity, food stamps, funding cuts, SNAP, Stanford",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,Campus and community resources are providing food assistance for students as SNAP funding is restored. The post Food insecure students weather SNAP disruptions following government shutdown appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"Carla Galaise ’27 has been food insecure her entire life. In her words, it’s been “exhausting.” Before moving to Stanford, Galaise attended community college as a single mother, relying on food stamps and her school’s food pantry to support herself and her son, now 11 years old. “I came to class so foggy-headed. When you don’t have those basic needs met, nothing else really matters,” Galaise said. “Even if you have food in the moment, if you don’t know where it’s going to be tomorrow, it messes with [you].” Nearly one in eight Americans receive food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Recipients, such as Galaise, faced food stamp delays during the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and ended Wednesday night. California used state money to fund its SNAP program, CalFresh, during the shutdown. “Benefits were delayed due to the Trump administration’s decision to oppose the issuance of full benefits during the shutdown,” the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) website states . Mona Hicks, the senior associate vice provost and dean of students, wrote to The Daily that the Dean of Students Office (DoS) does not have aggregate data on how SNAP cuts impacted Stanford students. “DoS is aware of individual students who rely on those funds. As a result, we are continuing to work in close collaboration with our campus partners, particularly FLISSC [First-Generation and/or Low-Income Student Success Center],” Hicks said. Now that the shutdown is over, benefits will continue as usual. For people who recently applied to CalFresh, the CDSS website states benefits may be delayed but will be provided soon. Worried about her food stamps during the shutdown, Galaise said she switched out of “thriving” and back to “surviving,” saving money and food stamps in case of total SNAP cuts. “The only reason I knew to do that is because I’ve experienced losing my food stamps, and it sparks all of those survival skills,” she said. About a week into November, despite warnings from SNAP about cuts, she received all of her food stamps. “I was so relieved. At Stanford, it’s all about, how can you thrive? If you’re still surviving, then you feel like you’re left behind,” she said. While her role as a food security advocate has helped Galaise feel more comfortable sharing her story, she said that food insecurity is “absolutely stigmatized” at Stanford. “Food insecurity here looks extremely different than it does at community college, but it’s still happening,” she said. “I think that’s important to talk about because this is the one place you think it wouldn’t be happening.” When she arrived at Stanford, she felt “such embarrassment” about food insecurity. “People just don’t want to talk about it. I was like, ‘I can’t go to the dean’s office and ask them for food. I’m the only one experiencing that,’” Galaise said. Now, Galise works as a student office assistant and basic needs intern at DoS, providing in-person administrative and office support. Since the beginning of the shutdown, DoS has heard directly from students on SNAP or CalFresh benefits who have been struggling, Hicks said. Along with developing a basic needs webpage of resources, DoS opened Thrive Market food pantry on Nov. 3. The market, which DoS is building out with shelf-stable foods, is located on the second floor of Tresidder Memorial Union. The disruption to SNAP funding prompted a “rush to get food on the shelves” so students could find resources on campus during the uncertainty of the shutdown. Other resources available to students like Galaise include Stanford Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE), which hosts monthly food pantry pop-ups where eligible students can receive produce, dairy, eggs and non-perishable items at no cost. Additionally, Territorial Markets is offering a SNAP Special Program to provide free groceries to those impacted by SNAP cuts. Several off-campus clubs are also helping provide food resources. From Nov. 17-21, two Palo Alto Rotary Clubs and a Kiwanis Club are holding a food drive for the Downtown Streets Team Food Closet at All Saints Episcopal Church Palo Alto. Richard Schoelerman, a member of the Rotary Club, said his club has been helping the food closet for almost two years. In light of possible SNAP delays, this week’s food drive will support people who need extra food assistance at this time. “Working with the other two service clubs, we decided that all three of us could do a better job of raising more food donations,” Schoelerman said. “It just so happens that it came at this time where the government shutdown came along.” The post Food insecure students weather SNAP disruptions following government shutdown appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."
Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly,"News, Campus Life, chef, Dining, dining halls, dinner, eating, Food, lunch, meals, R&DE, specials, Stanford, Stanford Dining",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,The chef’s dinner special in each dining hall is now available from Monday through Friday each week and posted in advance. The post Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE) has begun serving weekly chef’s dinner specials in each dining hall since Oct. 20. R&DE now also announces the specials in advance. The same special is served at dinner from Monday through Friday as one part of that meal’s menu and students are able to see each dining hall’s special via dining hall signage and Instagram posts on @stanforddining. Last year, dinner specials were not announced in advance and were only available while supplies lasted — typically for just one day. According to Eric Montell, the assistant vice provost for Stanford Dining, Hospitality and Auxiliaries, in an email to The Daily, the specials “operated like the classic chef’s special at a restaurant, a pleasant surprise you discovered when you went out to eat, with the wait staff announcing the chef’s special of the day when taking your order.” R&DE decided to pivot due to student feedback, Montell said. “Some students told us they’d prefer to know the chef special ahead of time so they could plan their dining around classes and other commitments,” Montell wrote. “Students also mentioned occasionally missing out on specials they wanted to try due to the one-day availability.” Though many students have not yet heard about the change, several liked the stability the new initiatives provide in comparison to the unpredictable nature of non-special food items. “A lot of times the website will be inaccurate, or sometimes there’ll be food items that they’ll talk about on the website, but then when you actually go in person to the dining hall, it’s something that’s pretty different,” said Siddharth Bellam ’29. Vivian Sullon Vicente ’29 agreed. “It should be really good to have a menu to see and realize where we want to go to eat,” she said. However, some students said they didn’t have the capacity to go to specific dining halls based on dinner specials. “Personally, when things are getting busy, I don’t really plan out ‘I want to eat this, therefore, I’ll go to XYZ dining hall,’” said Faith Qin ’29. “Instead I’m just like, what’s near me right now and what’s gonna close?” With less dining halls near their dorms, some students living on west campus felt they didn’t have easy access to as many of the specials as east campus students. “It can become repetitive, especially for me cause I eat dinner and breakfast at the same place pretty much everyday,” said Charlotte Burnham ’26. “It’s not the best when you don’t like the special either and get stuck with it. Sometimes consistency is nice, but I find people usually have a few dining halls they usually eat at, so it can definitely get old quick.” Ben Jonker ’28 appreciated the change but wished the dishes themselves were more unique. “It’s nice that they are making efforts to try and alleviate some of the problems of us eating the same three meals every day for the entire quarter, so in that extent I like it,” he said. “I think one of the problems with the way they’re doing specials right now is it’s a lot of the same stuff they would normally serve but just every day for the week. I don’t think I would ever go out of my way to go to a dining hall just because of the special.” R&DE offers many ways for diners to provide feedback. Soon, students will be invited to vote on future chef specials so “the menu further reflects what students are most excited to see,” according to Montell. For now, students can share their suggestions directly with the chefs in the dining halls — including at their weekly open office hours from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays — and complete the Dining Customer Satisfaction Survey sent directly to student emails, which will be open until Nov. 21. “We are grateful for the student feedback that is helping us make the dining program an even more welcoming and exciting part of campus life,” Montell wrote. “If there’s a dish students want, a cuisine they love or a dietary need we can support, please let your chef know, as we are here for students, and they are never an interruption in our day.” The post Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."
Torrential rains batter Stanford on path through California,"Campus Life, News, biking in the rain, drought, raining, Stanford, storm, weather",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,An atmospheric river storm moving through California hit Stanford for a second time Sunday night. The post Torrential rains batter Stanford on path through California appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"After a short weekend reprieve following Thursday’s downpour, Stanford will see half an inch of rain between 11 p.m. Sunday night and 2 p.m. Monday afternoon. On Thursday, Stanford, unable to escape an atmospheric river storm that brought strong winds and heavy rain to the Bay area and the Santa Cruz mountain, received 1.37 inches of rain. “It’s tough biking to class, for sure, especially when you forget your raincoat… you get soaked on the way,” said Griffin Jason Lee ’27. Lee, who is from Georgia, said the rain at Stanford is colder than storms he experienced at home. However, he looks forward to Lake Lagunita filling with water as the rainy season progresses. This weekend, the storm system moved south, settling in southern California and giving Bay Area residents a short break from torrential downpours before the storm returned late Sunday evening. Benjamin Vu ’28 said that the weather has been “pretty sad”. “I really like being out on a nice, sunny day. So, it’s been pretty hard walking around campus in the rain,” said Vu. Stanford’s rainy season typically lasts from October to May — this year’s inaugural rainstorm has come slightly later than expected. In fact, Stanford’s yearly precipitation has been on a steady decline in recent years. On average, in the last 30 years, Stanford has seen 14 inches of rain by mid-November, while this year only 10.41 inches of rain have fallen in the area. “The rains don’t seem that major,” said Shawn Gregory ’28. Gregory added that he thinks “we need more rain” due to the perpetual drought California is currently experiencing. Lee expressed concerns about biking in the rain without bike lights. “Stanford should give [students] bike lights,” said Lee. Vu added that it would be “really cool” if Stanford gave every student an umbrella. “If there are some innovators out there who can make umbrellas for while you are biking, I think that would be very helpful,” Gregory said.

AAUP | Three lessons the University must learn,"Opinions, Columnists, AAUP, American Association of University Professors, federal govenrment, free speech, Institutional neutrality, journalism, justice higher education, Stanford, student speech, trump administratino, university",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"In a new column from Stanford's chapter of the American Association of University Professors,  history professor Jessica Riskin offers three lessons for universities facing pressure from the federal government. The post AAUP | Three lessons the University must learn appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","The federal government is waging a war on higher education. The reason is obvious: universities are bastions of free thinking, deep thinking, critical thinking — and thinking, in all its forms, is what an authoritarian regime hates and fears the most. As soon as Trump took office, his administration began attacking the three elements of civil society that pose the greatest threat to authoritarian rule: the free press, which spreads knowledge of what’s happening in the halls of power; the justice system, which holds abusers of power to account and higher education, which teaches people to think. Surprisingly, our institutions of journalism, justice and higher education haven’t really fought back. Instead, they’ve acquiesced, paid extortionist fines and accepted intolerable restrictions. CBS agreed to submit transcripts from 60 Minutes for government vetting. The New York law firm Paul, Weiss agreed to change its diversity policies and provide $40 million in free legal work to the White House. Columbia University hired a new administrative officer who ensures compliance with government restrictions. Cornell accepted a similar settlement. Harvard dismissed the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies and eliminated its Women’s Center. At Stanford, the University closed our Office for Inclusion and Belonging, canceled a diversity-building doctoral fellowship (DARE) and announced there will be no student speakers at Commencement in an email to faculty. Universities must stop acquiescing and fight back. I’m going to talk about three things that are essential to our struggle. I. Solidarity The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), founded in 1915 to defend academic freedom, grew out of something that happened at Stanford in 1900. Jane Stanford, a founder of the University, and David Starr Jordan, the founding president, forced economics professor Edward Ross to resign after he criticized the railroad industry, the source of Stanford’s wealth. George Howard, a history professor, resigned in solidarity, beginning an exodus that grew to include 10% of the Stanford faculty. One of the academics who left was philosophy professor Arthur Lovejoy, the eventual founder of the AAUP. He and the other AAUP creators recognized that academic freedom requires collective action. The current assault on higher education takes various forms: threats to revoke accreditation for ideological reasons, the harassment and kidnapping of international students, attempts to dictate curricular content, suppression of academic programs or methodologies, draconian funding cuts and extortionist fines. Our fellow California university, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), is facing a $1.25 billion fine and demands for a federal ideology monitor. In the face of these attacks, institutional solidarity is a strategic necessity and a moral imperative. Solidarity begins with public statements — university presidents, boards of trustees and faculty senates should speak out when peer institutions are attacked — but that’s not enough. Professional associations must coordinate legal and advocacy resources. Accrediting bodies must refuse to become tools of political coercion. Alumni networks must mobilize. Students, faculty and staff must rally, protest, write and speak out. So far, this has largely failed to materialize. The schools facing billions of dollars in fines and funding freezes have each responded independently. The universities that received the offer of a “compact” requiring them to compromise their autonomy also responded individually. As Benjamin Franklin (may have) said, we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. II. Integrity, not Neutrality “Institutional neutrality” has become a pretext for institutional cowardice. The idea goes back to 1967, when, during a period of campus activism over the Vietnam War, the University of Chicago issued its “Report on the University’s Role in Political and Social Action. Chaired by law professor Harry Kalven Jr., the Kalven Report stated that universities should maintain “a heavy presumption against the university taking collective action or expressing opinions on the political and social issues of the day.” The report’s core principle was that “the instrument of dissent and criticism is the individual faculty member or the individual student. The university is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” The point was to allow competing views to coexist within a university community. More than half a century later, in 2018, universities suddenly began officially adopting the Kalven principles. Dozens have followed, including Stanford in 2024. This recent rush to embrace “neutrality” reflects a self-protective impulse, but it’s misguided. The Kalven Report notably acknowledged that universities must speak when their “very mission and its values of free inquiry” are under threat. The current moment throws the limits of institutional neutrality into sharp relief. Every university budget is a statement of values. Each hiring decision enacts priorities. All curricular choices embody commitments. When a university claims neutrality on all political questions while investing its endowment, designing its financial aid policies or determining which academic programs to expand or eliminate, it is disingenuous. The Kalven principle has value within limits, but we’re light years beyond them. What we need now is institutional integrity. We must openly defend what we stand for: free inquiry, evidence-based reasoning, equal access to education, the protection of vulnerable community members. If we remain “neutral” while our core values are attacked, we will have nothing left to defend. III. Student speech Institutions have recently responded to student activism by banning student speeches at commencements. In April 2024, the University of Southern California (USC) canceled valedictorian Asna Tabassum’s commencement speech following criticism of social media posts in which she expressed support for Palestinian rights. In May 2025, at George Washington University, graduating senior Cecilia Culver used her commencement speech to call for divestment from Israel. The university banned her from campus. That same month, NYU withheld graduate Logan Rozos’s diploma after he delivered an unapproved speech denouncing Israel’s attacks on Gaza. And in June 2025, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology banned its senior class president, Megha Vemuri, from the graduation ceremony after she delivered a pro- Palestinian speech at an earlier event. Now, Stanford has followed, quietly informing department chairs that there will be no student speakers at Commencement. This sends a terrible message to students: though your education has taught you to think freely, deeply and critically, we don’t trust you to speak publicly. Let us act in solidarity and with integrity. Let us trust our students to speak. Let us hear them. Let us above all stand up and fight back to defend higher education. If we don’t, who will? Jessica Riskin is a professor in the history department and the co-president of Stanford’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).

The post Text and the City: ‘Persepolis’ by Marjane Satrapi draws girlhood in ink and defiance appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"In “Text and the City,” Melisa Guleryuz ’27 reviews books through a lens of modern femininity. Editor’s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective thoughts, opinions and critiques. Marjane (“Marji”) Satrapi’s “Persepolis” is a graphic novel that pairs stark black-and-white art with a voice so alive, so rebellious and so uncensored that you forget you’re reading about a revolution until you feel it happening under your skin. In “Persepolis” — which, in a nod to Iran’s history, derives its title from the capital of the ancient Persian Empire — Satrapi tells the story of her childhood in Iran during the Islamic Revolution and her adolescence in Europe. She chronicles her life with the kind of clarity only a child — and then, a woman who has survived such things — can provide. Early in the book, young Satrapi announces, “I was born with religion,” a line that is humorous in its bluntness but heavy with reality. She proceeds to spend the rest of the memoir wrestling with the difficulty of having an identity handed to you before you know how to pronounce it. What stands out most in “Persepolis” is how Satrapi depicts the collision of innocence and political upheaval. One page shows Satrapi dreaming of being a prophet. The next portrays executions and bombings. Yet another illustrates her bargaining for a Michael Jackson button even though “it was strictly forbidden,” Satrapi writes. The memoir never sanitizes childhood; instead, it honors how children pick up the pieces adults break. At one point, Satrapi says, “The revolution is like a bicycle. When the wheels don’t turn, it falls.” It’s the kind of metaphor you don’t forget, because it comes from a girl who is trying desperately to understand why her world keeps collapsing. Satrapi’s feminism is loud, impulsive, contradictory and wonderfully human. Satrapi refuses to be the quiet, obedient daughter the new regime insists she become. When her school orders all girls to wear a veil, Satrapi says: “We didn’t really like to wear the veil, especially since we didn’t understand why we had to.” In her teenage years, when she buys Western clothes despite the risk, she tells us with pride that she feels “liberated,” even as Guardians of the Revolution scold her for her punk jacket. Satrapi shows how girlhood itself becomes an act of rebellion — that growing up with your own thoughts is threatening in a society where obedience is the preferred national sport. But “Persepolis” is more than a story of oppression. One of the most powerful lines in the memoir comes from Satrapi’s grandmother, who tells her, “Always keep your dignity and be true to yourself.” It’s a message that becomes the backbone of the book, as Satrapi shows how difficult — and how essential — that instruction is. Her feminism is inherited, nurtured and relentless. Even the women around her who do conform, who stay silent or wary, radiate a quiet strength. Refreshingly,  Satrapi treats them not as symbols but as people navigating impossible circumstances. The memoir is also sharply and unexpectedly funny in the way truth often is. Satrapi recounts how she and her classmates mocked their teachers, how she declared at age six that she wanted to be “the last prophet” and how she marched around pretending to lead the revolution. Humor becomes a survival skill, a way to stay human when humanity is under threat. Reviewer Rachel Moulden wrote that Satrapi’s voice “makes you laugh right before it breaks your heart.” She’s exactly correct. Then comes Satrapi’s departure from Iran for her own safety: Europe, loneliness, the confusion of being seen only as Iranian rather than as Marji. Here, the memoir shifts into a different tone. Satrapi begins to understand that freedom can be disorienting and that “sometimes you don’t know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice,” a line so striking, it is little wonder that it is often cited in reviews . Adolescent Satrapi is homesick, rebellious, depressed, self-destructive — and painfully honest about all of it. That honesty is what gives “Persepolis” its feminist core: it refuses to give us a sanitized heroine who triumphs through purity. Satrapi gives us a girl who is flawed, angry, brilliant and real. By the time Satrapi says, “I finally understood that I was nothing but a Westerner in Iran, an Iranian in the West,” the memoir becomes not just a personal story but a universal one about the longing to belong, the impossibility of fitting neatly into categories, the work of constructing an identity from fragments. “Persepolis” is not a tragedy, though it is full of heartbreak. It is not a political manifesto, though it critiques politics better than most manifestos do. It is, instead, a story about survival, the survival of humor, of girlhood, of truth, of resistance, of self. It is a reminder that becoming yourself is political in a world determined to tell you who you should be. When the book ends and Satrapi walks through the airport, leaving her country behind, the only thing she hears is her mother fainting. Satrapi closes her memoir with a haunting phrase: “It was the last time I ever saw them.” And that final panel — simple, devastating — tells you everything you need to know about the cost of freedom. In “Persepolis,” Satrapi makes her defiance clear through both the written word and art. And in doing so, she gives every reader — especially every woman — permission to do the same.

The post Senior Scaries: Treating dating like the job market appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","In each installment of “Senior Scaries,” Erin Ye ’26 confronts her senior-year fears in her final three quarters at Stanford. You’ll hear about the triumphs and tribulations of tackling the Senior Bucket List and hopefully feel less alone in the never-ending soul search that comes with growing up. The last time I was on the phone with my mom, she told me that it was my own fault I didn’t have a boyfriend. “You need to start treating dating like it’s the job market: you’re not applying to positions, you’re not interviewing, you’re not even doing things that you can add to your résumé,” she said. “You just need to get out there. Think of it like getting an internship . Don’t worry about the return offer just yet!” The metaphor was likely absurd on purpose, but underneath the shock factor, my mom had a point. I can’t blame her for being tired of me complaining about a problem I haven’t meaningfully tried to solve. In high school, I was far too nerdy to date, and I’ve dated very minimally during my time at Stanford. I remember my (happily taken) freshman-year roommate telling me late one night in our room, “It happens when you least expect it!” I responded, “That’s the problem. I am always expecting it.” Fast forward to senior year, and I am still bound by the same affliction. At this point, I’ve made every excuse in the book: too busy with school, too focused on my career, not interested in anybody, yada yada yada . I’ve also had many conversations with friends that have gone along the lines of “Stanford-men-are-the-problem-we’re-perfect-as-we-are.” When you look at it like that, it’s not surprising at all that I don’t have a boyfriend. I’ve made it pretty obvious I don’t want one. And I really am happy with my life as it is. I have the best friends and family in the world, I love what I study and I have a job lined up after graduation. There’s no lack of love in my existence. I think, for me, this conversation is more about conquering an age-old insecurity and not letting a fear of rejection hold me back from good things in the future. It’s not enough to sit around waiting for a bomb to drop or to wonder why no one has left a love letter at your door or to do Date Drop and Marriage Pact and expect black-box algorithms to find your soulmate for you (especially when you don’t even have the guts to reach out to your match). At the very least, your internal wants and external actions need to align. Yes, it is scary to be graduating from college and entering the murky waters of the post-grad dating scene. Stanford was probabilistically the best place to find a good match, and it’s both awesome and horrifying to think that some of the people I know are already dating the person they’re going to marry. But just like how you don’t get hired by being envious of those who are employed, I’ll likely stay single forever if all I do is take stock of the couples around me. I wish I could have written this column about how I conquered my fears and went on 50 first dates, but that’s not happened yet. But once I develop a pick up line as good as my cover letter template, it’s game on. The post Senior Scaries: Treating dating like the job market appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

The post GSC passes conditional collaboration with OCS, defers vote on club sports and natural gas appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","The Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted unanimously to confirm conditional collaboration with the Office of Community Standards (OCS) in its Thursday meeting. The council also deferred votes on bills that would reduce University natural gas use and dissolve club sports’ funding umbrella. The Joint Bill Affirming Conditional Collaboration with the Office of Community Standards (OCS) and Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) affirms that the Undergraduate Senate (UGS) and the GSC will abstain from electing panelists to the OCS unless it enacts reforms. Among the bill’s proposed changes are increased availability of OCS office hours, more extensive student advocacy efforts, faster case investigation timelines, stricter evidentiary standards to initiate investigations and increased transparency of OCS cases. “We want to show the OCS that we appreciate their willingness to collaborate,” said Tom Liu, a sixth-year physics Ph.D. student. “At the same time, this is not an approval of the way things currently are and we expect them to make changes.” The GSC also deferred a decision on the Joint Resolution on Protecting the Stanford Community and Environment from Natural Gas, co-authored by 2024-25 UGS Treasurer Jadon Urogdy ’27 and members of Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS). The bill proposes a number of measures to reduce natural gas use on Stanford’s campus, such as ceasing construction of “natural gas infrastructure” on campus, replacing broken appliances with electric ones and phasing out natural gas appliances in University buildings. The GSC voted not to pass the bill when it was first brought to the council this May, requesting that representatives of Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE) review SSS’s requests before the bill was subjected to a vote by the UGS and GSC. In Thursday’s meeting, the GSC agreed to defer a vote on the bill until its authors edit it in accordance with R&DE’s feedback. “R&DE came to the meeting [in May], and they gave us the impression that this was the first time they were seeing these demands,” said Áron Ricardo Perez-Lopez, a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. student. “I, as a GSC officer, would expect the authors of the bill to try to consult R&DE first.” The GSC also moved to postpone its vote on the Joint Bill to Dissolve the Club Sports Funding Umbrella and Require Direct Team-Level Grant Applications for Transparency and Compliance. If passed, the bill would require club sports to submit grants directly to the UGS and GSC, rather than to the Club Sports Council. “A lot of changes that club sports has been making to how funding is allocated is not consistent with the ASSU constitution,” said GSC Chair Rory O’Dwyer, a sixth-year physics Ph.D. student. “They’re moving significant sums of money around, inconsistent with how they should be allocated.” The post GSC passes conditional collaboration with OCS, defers vote on club sports and natural gas appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

Although Stanford’s climate shows limited seasonal variation, students are still able to find signs of fall across campus. Katie Klein ’29 often passes by Terman Fountain by the Doerr School of Sustainability and admires the brightly colored trees. “There’s some tables where you can sit and study, and it’s very peaceful, and it’s really a nice place to do your homework,” Klein said. (Photo: NAINA MEHROTRA/The Stanford Daily) For students living on West Campus, neighboring Roble Field is home to similarly colorful trees that would make a picturesque setting for a picnic or study session as they shed vibrantly colored leaves. (Photo: NAINA MEHROTRA/The Stanford Daily) Many students frequent Arguello Field to catch views of fall foliage. Jessie Kong ’26 remembers the green area between Wilbur Hall and Stern Hall as one of her favorite places on campus during autumn quarter last year and is excited to see that the trees are just as beautiful this year. “I lived in Okada last year, and so every morning when I’d bike out to class, I’d pass by there, and the leaves are so pretty,” said Kong.

Freshman star leads comeback win over Montana State,"Men's Basketball, Sports, Winter Sports, ACC, basketball, Benny Gealer, Cardinal, Chisom Okpara, Ebuka Okorie, Kyle Smith, Stanford, Stanford men's basketball",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"Men's basketball picked up another win over a Big Sky opponent as freshman Ebuka Okorie, who leads all freshmen in the nation in scoring, tallied 21 points. The post Freshman star leads comeback win over Montana State appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Through three games, Stanford men’s basketball (3-0, 0-0 ACC) has found a go-to scorer. However, now the Cardinal have to continue developing the supporting cast. Freshman guard Ebuka Okorie continued his electric start to the season Wednesday night, pouring in 21 points — 15 after halftime — as Stanford closed on a 22-7 run to beat Montana State (1-3, 0-0 Big Sky) 77-68 at Maples Pavilion. The win marked the Cardinal’s third straight victory over a Big Sky opponent to open the season, but it again underscored how much they lean on their first-year star. Okorie, who leads all Division I freshmen in scoring and is seventh overall in the nation at 25.3 points per game, shot 7-of-15 from the field and added three assists and multiple key defensive plays down the stretch. Head coach Kyle Smith admitted afterward that the offense runs heavily through the 6-foot-2 guard. “We’re pretty Ebuka-centric,” Smith said following the game. “We’ve got to learn how to play without him. He’s not always going to play his best game, but at the end of the day he had a pretty good line and was one of the best players out there.” Stanford led by as many as 10 in the first half before Montana State clawed back, taking a six-point lead with just over eight minutes remaining. From there, Okorie helped steady the Cardinal. Okorie converted a three-point play and later drilled a late-clock three-pointer during the closing surge, while Stanford tightened up defensively, forcing the Bobcats into tough one-on-one shots. “He brought his best when it was needed,” Smith said of Okorie. “He’s a good competitor, to be able to do that as a freshman and stay locked in.” The freshman did not lead the comeback effort by himself though. Senior guard Benny Gealer and senior forward Chisom Okpara provided vital balance, finishing with 16 and 15 points, respectively, while graduate forward AJ Rohosy added 13 points and a team-high seven rebounds. Gealer set the tone early, scoring Stanford’s first eight points and hitting a trio of three-pointers in the first half, then knocked down another big triple late as the Cardinal pulled away. “I stayed aggressive. I’m a shooter because I trust my shot and just let the game come to me,” said Gealer, who finished 4-of-6 from beyond the arc. “So if I’m open and I get my feet under me, I think it helps our team if I’m aggressive and space the floor. It was a big team win for us. There was some adversity in the middle and our team was able to get over that hump.” Okpara repeatedly punished the Bobcats inside, helping Stanford turn a cold 5-of-19 night from behind the arc into a paint-heavy attack that produced 46 points in the paint. “The main thing was just playing defense and staying in front one-on-one,” Okpara said. “And so we just had to lock in on defense and stop the ball and just continue to play through the inside.” Still, the reliance on the starting five was glaring. Stanford’s starters scored 73 of the team’s 77 points, with the bench going just 1-of-15 from the field and contributing four points. Smith pointed to illness and rhythm issues for some regular reserves, but he did not sugarcoat the production gap. “Our bench did not produce,” Smith said. “I mean, we were 1-for-15 off the bench. That’s not good. It’s just not good enough. [Ryan Agarwal] had been sick, and he’s an important part of our deal. He’s just not 100% right now and needs to get back in the flow.” One bright spot off the bench was freshman forward Oskar Giltay, who played only five minutes but delivered two blocks and two rebounds, sparking Stanford’s defensive intensity in the second half. Smith called the decision to insert Giltay, who had not practiced much this past week, a bit of a gamble. “I was like, ‘You know what, let’s just put him in this situation,’ and he was huge,” Smith said. “Two blocked shots, an offensive rebound and a defensive rebound. He really flipped the game for us.” Okpara was also quick to praise the contribution of Giltay. “For a freshman to stay ready like that, who didn’t play last game and didn’t play the first half, and then come in right away with great blocks and defensive presence, he gave us great energy and a big boost,” he said. Even at 3-0, it is clear that this team is still learning how to play together, and how to win when Okorie is not carrying the load. “It’s good to be 3-0, but we’re in the next-practice mentality,” Gealer said. “We’ve got four or five practices before the next game, and we’ve got to get better and work on our weaknesses. Our coaches always preach, ‘Respect everyone, fear no one.’” Up next, Stanford welcomes the Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns to Maples Pavilion for a 7 p.m. tip-off on Tuesday.

From the Community | Why we condemn the politicized prosecution of the Stanford 11,"From the Community, Opinions, Building 10, charge, Court, criminal, DA, felony, misdemeanor, occupation, Palestine, prosecution, protest, stanford 11",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,Law students Sarah Jung and Mohamed Nur write about the politicized prosecution of the Stanford 11. The post From the Community | Why we condemn the politicized prosecution of the Stanford 11 appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"The Stanford 11 students’ case is not merely an internal dispute over campus policy, but an unprecedented legal assault designed to criminalize dissent. Understanding the facts of the criminal case against the Stanford 11 demonstrates how the very university we attend weaponizes its privilege, power and wealth to chill dissent and student activism, and how District Attorney Rosen’s office is leveraging its prosecutorial discretion to disproportionately punish and criminalize student protest. Since October 2023, student protestors have demonstrated against the genocide of Palestinian people through rallies, walkouts, teach-ins, encampments, hunger strikes and negotiations with university administrators. They argue that Stanford’s ongoing investments in companies with financial ties to Israel directly violate university policy on investment responsibility, pushing for divestment. The June 5 occupation of Building 10 followed in this long line of broader efforts by students to organize, not from personal interest or malice, but from a realization that escalating tactics were necessary to call attention to Stanford’s moral inconsistencies. Rosen is now charging 11 students with felony conspiracy to trespass and felony vandalism. They face up to three years and eight months in prison, or alternatively, $329,000 in restitution payments and community service in exchange for pleading guilty. The trial is set for Nov. 17. Rosen is the only prosecutor in the country who has brought felony charges against pro-Palestinian student protestors. In June 2024, New York prosecutors dismissed misdemeanor criminal trespass charges against the majority of Columbia University student protestors who occupied Hamilton Hall, citing insufficient evidence and probable cause. The 13 defendants who participated in the protest but were not enrolled in Columbia accepted an offer from the Manhattan DA’s office that resulted in full dismissal of charges following a six-month probationary period and completion of an in-person class on “peaceful and legal protesting.” The Michigan Attorney General dropped charges against seven University of Michigan students arrested for trespass during a May 2024 pro-Palestine protest, and the LA City Attorney’s office declined to file charges against the vast majority of the hundreds arrested at UCLA and USC campuses during the spring protests, citing insufficient evidence. The decision to bring any level of criminal charge is a question of prosecutorial discretion that most other prosecutors have elected not to pursue. But Rosen elected to bring not just misdemeanor, but felony charges. Both felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass charges are legally considered “ wobblers ,” meaning they could have been filed as misdemeanors. Rosen chose to seek the most punitive convictions possible. Additionally, this case involves the weaponization of restitution, intended to provide financial compensation to a crime victim. The amount that Stanford is demanding is far greater than justified by any publicly available documentation. Stanford’s Facilities Director for Lands, Buildings and Real Estate, Mitch Bousson, testified that he estimates the following damages: repairs to a grandfather clock ($1,000), repairing and replacing the broken window ($2,666) , and repairing a doorframe and door ($6,305). His estimate comes nowhere close to the $329,000 that Stanford is demanding in restitution. Other damages were caused by Stanford law enforcement officers who forced entry into the building even after protestors communicated that they would exit peacefully, according to court filings. The state also issued felony charges through a grand jury proceeding rather than a preliminary hearing. A grand jury proceeding is a private, secretive proceeding: only the prosecution and grand jurors were permitted to be present. The defendants had no right to appear, present evidence or cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses. The grand jury hearing transcript remains closed to the public, meaning no other information on repair costs is available. Given that the restitution is set at such a high sum and would pose a significant financial burden to the students involved, Stanford and the DA’s office should provide receipts or payment invoices that irrefutably prove the actual damages amount to the sum requested. It has been over a year and a half since the occupation of the president’s office. Most other pro-Palestinian student protestors were charged at the time of their protests, over a year ago. Rosen stands alone in bringing these charges in April 2025, almost a year after the occupation happened. Defendants have been in agonizing limbo ever since. The students have already gone through disciplinary proceedings brought by the University before Rosen filed charges. Students faced suspensions , deferred degrees and loss of health care, housing and scholarship grants. They have also experienced online harassment and death threats according to their testimonies. Stanford has acted as an active collaborator in this politically-driven prosecution. The university implemented a surveillance campaign against protestors, hiring a private security firm to surveil the pro-Palestine encampment. Cameras were installed in White Plaza in the context of a broader effort to surveil students. The University admitted that they used “camera footage, eyewitness testimonies, and social media posts” to identify students. In a typical criminal investigation, complainants do not direct the police investigation. But according to court filings, Stanford shared disciplinary records and hearing information with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and Santa Clara DA after the occupation. Also according to court filings, multiple cell phones and a camera in the possession of the Stanford 11 were taken into evidence. DPS and Rosen’s office transferred these belongings to the United States Secret Service (USSS), rather than to the Santa Clara County Crime Lab, breaking from typical procedure. USSS broke through encryption to access text messages that form the basis of the felony conspiracy charges. Rosen’s punitive prosecution and Stanford’s complicity have fused to create a legal strategy that charges protected civil disobedience as felonious behavior. We must rally in defense of the Stanford 11 and demand that DA Rosen drop the charges against them to protect the constitutional right to free speech, the right to assemble and organize and the right to demonstrate and fight for justice. These students and alumni are young people with bright academic futures and entire lives ahead of them. Felony convictions will follow these students permanently, making it difficult to obtain housing and precluding them from pursuing employment and career opportunities. To stand up for these protestors, sign this petition and take action through this toolkit . Call DA Rosen’s office to support dropping these unprecedented charges, and call Stanford to demand that they lower their baseless restitution claim.

Stanford Creates: YouTuber Adam Liao ’29 breaks down craftsmanship and content creation ,"Culture, Arts & Life, 3D-printing, Adam Liao, content creator, creator, profile, Stanford, stanford frosh, videography, YouTuber",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"In her newest column installment, Chen interviews a DIY project YouTuber on what introduced him to content creation and how he hopes to grow at Stanford. The post Stanford Creates: YouTuber Adam Liao ’29 breaks down craftsmanship and content creation appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","In “Stanford Creates,” Emily Chen ’29 highlights student endeavors in the arts and how they bring them to life at Stanford. Adam Liao ’29 is a creator of all kinds. He’s an expert maker and videographer — and with over 100 videos, his YouTube channel , 3A Creates, shares and highlights his passion for unexpected innovation. Liao started his channel during the pandemic. Bored by lockdown, he just wanted to experiment with putting something out there for the world to see. Liao uploaded his first YouTube video, a 30-second clip of his pet, with few expectations and felt “very surprised that a hundred people somewhere in the world cared enough to watch a video of a lizard eating a worm.” From that first video, his new hobby flourished into something more serious. Combining his passion for radio-controlled cars with his video editing skills, Liao started making STEM videos where he turns innovative ideas into reality through a DIY approach. Whether 3D-printing a designer bag or building a self-driving solar rover, Liao is determined to bring his audience along every step of the way. “I think Adam has a confident expression in his videos that allows his viewers to feel his energy while enjoying the content,” said Adam’s friend, Henry Deng ’29. Through his videos, Liao embraces the process of trial and error — and is unafraid to show his failures and willingness to rebuild. “The nature of building something is that there is no script to follow,” he said. “I don’t actually script the video before I build, I script it as I build.” This mindset is evident in a great deal of his content: in a video on 3D-printed wall art, for example, Liao creates multiple iterations of 3D-printed mesh, walking viewers through the process of varying the mesh holes’ size and thickness in order to create the most polished product possible. In addition to showing the trial-and-error aspect of crafting, the art of video-making and content curation is just as important to Liao. “Usually nobody wants to see you code the software for an hour,” he said. “They want to see you putting [something together].” As a creator, Liao cites many sources of inspiration, taking inspiration for storytelling and viewer retention from popular channels such as Ryan Trahan and Mr. Beast. Over the years, he’s become more adept at video editing — weaving engaging sound effects, memes and varying camera angles into his videos. Viewers find joy in the multimedia features sprinkled throughout Liao’s channel. “​​Adam’s videos help me get cultured on the freshest memes, and his relatability gives me the boost I need every week,” said Adam’s friend, Manit Mehta ’29. As an artist developing his craft, Liao believes that when first jumping into video creation, one should prioritize quantity over quality. Having struggled with perfectionism in the past, he emphasized the importance of learning over pursuit of a flawless product. “Don’t be afraid to put out 10 mediocre videos versus one perfect video,” he said. “You actually learn more through making 10 mediocre videos than making one perfect video.” Looking to the future, Liao is gearing up to take his passions to the next level by “div[ing] deeper into the technical aspect of building something.” In addition to his engineering studies, he is currently undergoing training at Stanford’s Product Realization Lab, learning to use new machinery and “unlock[ing] the spectrum of things that [he] could build.” Liao also hopes to collaborate with creators at the intersection of music, film and social media in order to further his storytelling ability. Outside of his own YouTube channel, “I’ve worked on many documentaries [and] music videos,” he said. “So if anyone wants a short form content creator or social media manager, hit me up.” The post Stanford Creates: YouTuber Adam Liao ’29 breaks down craftsmanship and content creation appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."
Surreal @ Stanford: Mid Terms,"The Grind, grass, mid, mid term, midterm season, midterms, outside, stress",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,How can midterm season stretch far beyond the middle of a quarter? Rastogi reflects on her first experiences in the quarter system and how her perception of time has been altered. The post Surreal @ Stanford: Mid Terms appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"“Surreal @ Stanford” is an attempt to quantify the gaps and the bridges, the cold and the comforting, of attending Stanford. Whether it’s a first In-N-Out order or the sudden feeling of inadequacy, we’ve all undergone new things since our arrival. In this column, Tanya Rastogi ’29 seeks to explore that liminality. “Mid” is used in many ways. Originally, it was a prefix referring to the middle of something, like “mid-day,” or “mid-October.” Recent internet language has shifted its connotation to something more like “mediocre” — below average, boring, unappealing. In Stanford terms, “mid” is eternity. It is Week 4. It is Week 6. It is Week 8. My professors really enjoy the phrase “midterm season” — it’s a great catch-all for every stressor a student could experience. Midterm season is the veil of reasoning applied to the dead silence in the lecture hall after a question. It’s the explanation for dark circles and messy dorm rooms and, hell, the darkness that now blankets campus at 5 p.m. Midterm season. Doesn’t that sound so heavy? When over half the quarter is spent preparing for impending exams, the weight of this term can be reduced or bloated. One one hand, if everything is midterms, they can’t be so bad, right? But then it is indeed so bad, and frosh with the light still in their eyes realize that they have 11 quarters remaining of this. The rationale for this sadistic schedule (I’m looking at the chemistry department in particular; my friends in the 31 series have suffered greatly) is unclear. We’re already on a quarter system. Our temporal perception of a school year has already been stretched by 50%. Why must that year be pulled further by the claws of deadlines and late-night study sessions and Canvas notifications that are somehow always sent out during the function? The afternoon a few days before my exams — both conveniently on the same date — I sat outside at the tables in front of Tresidder. I needed to get out of my dorm, where I’d be distracted, and the libraries, where I was undergoing a hibernative transformation induced by fluorescent lighting and dry stuffy air. I figured that if my exams would have me staring into a laptop screen for hours on end, the least I could do for myself was let myself see the sun. In my ears blasted the same playlist that had been running on repeat for the past two hours. It cycled through the final song, and I ran it back from the beginning. “California Dreamin’” kicked in with its first wistful plucks of guitar. All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray … A light breeze grazed my skin, ruffled the leaves below me. Traces of laughter from the surrounding tables broke faintly through the music. Above my head, the clouds were wispy and white. All the leaves were orange, and the sky was blue, so blue. For just one instance, all my troubles evaporated to the warm air. … Maybe this is what happens when Stanford students touch grass. Maybe midterms have us all delirious. Whatever it is, there is more than life to academics. Go outside. The post Surreal @ Stanford: Mid Terms appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

The post Gottlieb | Policy may not be your major, but it governs your reality appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Hoover Tower looms over campus, dominating our skyline in a metaphor for the political power that permeates society. It may seem counterintuitive that the largest landmark at a school known for its stellar sciences and proximity to Silicon Valley is not tech-oriented. In 1941, the tower was commissioned by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover to house “rare library and archival materials.” Over 80 years later, I now frequent the tower as a student fellow at the Hoover Institute and am equally invested in government through my political science major. And so, I was recently disappointed to see a news piece from The Daily on the apparent apathy students felt towards political engagement and the low attendance for Democracy Day panels and events on Meyer Green last week. I was on one of those panels, and we discussed the First Amendment, a relevant and contentious issue on most college campuses. The panel held voices across the political spectrum, including me and Jennifer Levine ’28, the co-managing editors of The Daily’s Opinions section, Joe Nail MBA ’26, the founder and president of the America Club and Robert Liu ’28, the vice president of Stanford College Democrats. The low turnout wasn’t a hit to my ego. I enjoyed the conversation with the other panelists, and I attributed the sparse audience to a busy midterm season, tired students and, hopefully, off-campus voting. However, I’m not so sure the low turnout for events on Meyer Green that day accurately reflected the entire Stanford student body. The night of Democracy Day, I attended Dine and Dialogue, an event that brought together faculty and students through engaging political discussion. Unlike earlier programming, the event was so packed that I, along with several other students, had to wait for more chairs to be brought in. Some students had to stand next to tables to join the conversation. Student interest in government isn’t just limited to Democracy Day, either. When Gov. Ron DeSantis came to speak , the auditorium was filled, and most students were unable to get access to the event. The classes I take as a political science major are usually so popular that professors have long waitlists, and the discipline provides unparalleled access to professionals working in government. Although computer science is the most common major at Stanford, political science and international relations also rank in the ten most popular majors. As a testament to Stanford’s robust academic political scene, I’m in an American intelligence class taught by Amy Zegart called “Spies, Lies, and Algorithms,” where we’ve had the privilege of hearing from guest speaker Christopher Wray, the former director of the FBI. This past weekend, the entire class engaged in a day-long intelligence simulation where we worked in teams acting as different intelligence agencies (what the intelligence community calls “wargames”). A class with roughly 100 students waking up at 8 a.m. participating in a simulation on a Saturday does not signal apathy. It demonstrates a deep passion for policy and government. We have spaces for liberals, moderates and conservatives. The Hoover Institute, although officially nonpartisan, has a reputation for conservative leanings. Students on The Stanford Review staff feel Stanford offers more to conservatives than the Ivies do. But unlike the Ivies or other top East Coast schools, Stanford’s political fervor feels limited to the minority of students actively engaged in politics. The dominating culture on campus feels largely apolitical. Policy obviously affects our personal rights and interests. And yet, I’ve noticed that aside from ultra-significant issues like abortion , it’s often hard to feel like policy matters in our isolated Stanford bubble. Involvement in government is still essential for everyone. Although I study political science, am a Hoover undergraduate research fellow and remain engaged in the campus political scene, I don’t plan on starting my career in Washington. I’m invested in politics because, while I pursue other professional interests, from finance and media to consumer retail and real estate, policy remains steadfastly intertwined in everything I do. Financial markets are tied to geopolitical events, such as the Middle East crisis in Gaza.  The media is not always safe from governmental powers. Consumer and retail patterns are shaped by tariffs implemented by new administrations. Real estate regulations limit both platforms and properties . Computer science majors, too, should be engaged in government. Artificial intelligence (AI) policy is crucial to the future of the technology sector, and the startup world is reliant on public policy. The longest government shutdown might have finally ended because of a reopening deal involving healthcare policy . The basis for all these disciplines — university research — is very political. In 2024, a Daily article found that 75% of Stanford’s 7,500 research projects were funded by the U.S. government. Policy is embedded within all disciplines and professions. I urge Stanford students to take this to heart — and turn that conviction into action. No matter what you’re studying or what your post-grad plans are, policy will always be relevant. I’m almost certain that the political science major won’t surpass computer science anytime soon. And next year, my feelings won’t be hurt if you don’t show up to the panel discussions, even if I’m speaking. My wish for the Stanford community is for all students to see the value in increasing their engagement in government and understanding the relationship between policy and their interests. To create lasting impact, we must realize that policy transcends the ballot. It’s critical to everything we do.

"UGS affirms conditional collaboration with OCS, supports reinstatement of land acknowledgement","News, Campus Life, Featured, bill, club sports council, land acknowledgement, OCS, OCS reform, SAIO, Stanford, student government, UGS, Undergraduate senate",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"The Undergraduate Senate emphasized its support for Office of Community Standards reform and passed a bill supporting the reinstatement of land acknowledgements at their Wednesday meeting. The post UGS affirms conditional collaboration with OCS, supports reinstatement of land acknowledgement appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","In its Wednesday meeting, the Undergraduate Senate (UGS) passed a bill confirming its continued collaboration with the Office of Community Standards (OCS) and called for the reinstatement of University land acknowledgements. The UGS’ collaboration with OCS also includes the Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) and is conditional on meaningful progress towards OCS reform this year. The Joint Bill Affirming Conditional Collaboration With the Office of Community Standards (OCS) and Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) stated that if progress is not made, nominations to future conduct panels may not be approved. As examples of desired reforms, the bill cited increased communication and better mechanisms for enforcing speedy investigation timelines. “My primary view of this bill is that it is giving prior notice to the administration and OCS of levers that we do have, reminding them of that and what we expect out of a system that they expect us to be complicit in,” one of the bill’s authors, Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) executive vice president Will Berriman ’26 said. The UGS also passed the Joint Resolution to Support the Reinstatement of Stanford University’s Land Acknowledgement. The resolution supports the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO)’s petition to reinstate a land acknowledgement at campus-wide ceremonies. Since the resolution has been passed by both the UGS and the Graduate Student Council (GSC), it will now be sent to the Faculty Senate and relevant administrators, who will review the request for reinstatement. UGS chair David Sengthay ’26 said that sending this resolution to the Faculty Senate is important given the administration’s inaction on the issue, even after meetings with SAIO co-chairs and the chairperson of the Muwekma Ohlone tribe. The UGS also introduced the Joint Bill to Dissolve the Club Sports Funding Umbrella and Require Direct Team-Level Grant Applications for Transparency and Compliance. This bill will dissolve the Club Sports Council, which currently allocates funds to individual club sports. Sengthay said that Club Sports Council has been able to modify the amount of money that can be given to a club from voter-approved budgets, which should not happen without the two-thirds majority approval of the UGS and GSC through the funding chairs, the appropriations committee or the GSC treasurers, as stated in the ASSU Constitution. “We understand that these weren’t acts of bad faith… we just think that the funding system doesn’t work anymore, and it pays too much discretion to one council that wasn’t beholden to the voters,” Sengthay said. If this bill is passed, individual club sports will directly apply for funding from the ASSU as independent Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs) starting in the next academic year. The UGS will vote on the bill next week. The post UGS affirms conditional collaboration with OCS, supports reinstatement of land acknowledgement appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

The post Research Roundup: ‘mini brains’ and mindful design appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","The Science & Technology desk gathers a weekly digest of impactful and interesting research publications and developments at Stanford. Read the latest in this week’s Research Roundup. Modeling human brain development with assembloids Stanford neuroscientist Sergiu Pasca, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and director of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis Program, is pioneering the use of lab-grown “mini brains,” also known as assembloids, to explore how the human brain develops and functions. “The human brain largely builds itself,” Pasca said, describing how various brain organoids will self-organize and form connections when placed together in a dish. When organoids fuse in this way, they become assembloids, which researchers can use to model specific brain regions. By creating assembloids, Pasca and his lab team can study how different brain regions form connections, a process that was once impossible to observe directly. Pasca emphasizes that these models are tools, not complete brains. “An assembloid is not a brain — it’s just a working model of some of the circuitry resident in a living, functioning human brain,” he said. Researchers at the Pasca Lab use assembloids to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as Timothy syndrome, a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder that causes neurological disorders and autism. These studies are helping researchers understand how genetic mutations alter brain development. While questions remain regarding the ethics of creating complex human neural systems, including how far scientists can go in modeling consciousness, Pasca’s research marks a major step toward understanding and potentially treating the human brain’s most elusive disorders. Sweet spot for online loading Nobody likes to wait — and especially online. But new research from the Graduate School of Business (GSB) suggests that the right kind of animation can make digital delays feel shorter and keep users from clicking away. In a series of studies led by Yu Ding, assistant professor of marketing at the GSB, and Ellie Kyung, a researcher at Babson College, researchers found that moderate-speed animations, as opposed to static images or rapid animations, can significantly reduce perceived page load wait time and improve user engagement. The findings were inspired by a moment of irritation. When Ding noticed how a lingering logo on his TV made him want to change the channel, he became curious about how brands could keep users engaged during unavoidable pauses online. Across experiments involving more than 1,400 participants, moderate-speed animations consistently led to better outcomes. In one test, Facebook users were more likely to wait through a 20-second page load if shown a moderately moving image. In another, participants who saw moderate animations during a short wait were more likely to complete a task and reported higher satisfaction with products they viewed afterward. The results point to a simple, low-cost way for companies to improve digital experiences. “If something is moving too slowly, people just don’t pay attention… The middle point is the sweet spot,” Ding said. AI rivals humans in political persuasion Artificial intelligence (AI) may be just as convincing as humans when it comes to politics, according to new research from the GSB. Robb Willer, professor of sociology and organizational behavior at the GSB (by courtesy), and Zakary Tormala, the Laurence W. Lane professor of behavioral science and marketing at the GSB, led complementary studies examining how people respond to political messages written by AI compared to those written by humans. Willer’s team found that AI-generated messages were equally persuasive across a range of policy issues, including gun control, carbon taxes and voter registration. Participants’ opinions shifted similarly regardless of whether messages came from people or machines. Tormala’s research revealed a striking twist: when participants were told that a message came from AI, they were more open to opposing viewpoints. People perceived AI as less biased and more informed than human messengers, making them more receptive to counterarguments and more likely to share or seek out information that challenged their beliefs. The findings suggest that AI could be used to reduce political polarization by presenting information in ways people trust more. “We were thinking AI might sometimes do better than human sources in this context because people believe AI has no persuasive intent, is not inherently biased and has access to a wealth of information,” Tormala told the Stanford Report. However, the same psychological effect could also enable the spread of misinformation, Tormala warned.

Her POV: Who gets to survive ‘A House Of Dynamite’ in the United States?,"Screen, Arts & Life, a house of dynamite, Bigelow, intelligence, Movie, movie review, national security, nonproliferation, nuclear, nuclear attack, political thriller, POTUS, power dynamics, surveillance, U.S.",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"Director Kathryn Bigelow’s latest film, “A House of Dynamite,” explores the fallout from a nuclear attack on a major U.S. city, zeroing in on how power operates among the powerful. The post Her POV: Who gets to survive ‘A House Of Dynamite’ in the United States? appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","In the event of a nuclear attack on a major city in the United States, who will be sacrificed? And who will be saved? “A House of Dynamite” (2025), directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is set in a post-post-Cold War era where world powers have reneged on their commitments to nuclear non-proliferation. After an intercontinental ballistic missile is launched from across the Pacific Ocean, several government agencies must coordinate their response, and what begins as an ordinary day transforms into a series of high-wire decisions. I was drawn to “A House of Dynamite” for its star-studded cast, despite feeling skeptical at the prospect of a political thriller from Bigelow. Her previous films include “Zero Dark Thirty” (2012) and “The Hurt Locker” (2009), with the latter film earning her Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Although Bigelow has been lauded for her slice-of-life approach to war and foreign policy, movies that depict America as a global peacekeeper require too much suspension of disbelief for me. The U.S. has been an instigator in many conflicts, and the best storytelling acknowledges this complex reality. Fortunately, though America is under siege in “A House of Dynamite,” the film largely avoids jingoism, excelling when it zeroes in on how power operates among the powerful. The story begins with minimal exposition. The action moves quickly through the alphabet soup of operational security agencies and the ensemble members who first notice the unidentified object hurtling across the Pacific Ocean — a pace which helps establish the vastness of the security apparatus. Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) tasks her husband with tending to their son’s fever while she heads into work at the White House Situation Room, seamlessly swapping her sensible sneakers for nude pumps as she goes through security. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) worker Cathy Rogers (Moses Ingram) attends to a personal matter involving a divorce attorney during her commute. Meanwhile, Major Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) marches into the command center in Fort Greely, Alaska and chides a colleague for eating in a restricted area. The most levelheaded taskmasters begin to falter as the DEFCON level drops. Once it becomes clear the unidentified object is a weapon, the available avenues of response hardly seem ideal. According to the Deputy National Security Advisor (Gabriel Basso), the U.S. might have to hit a bullet with a bullet. But will the destruction of the weapon cause more collateral damage than it prevents? At the core of Bigelow’s work is power — how it functions and who benefits from it. Beyond the insignia on the various military branch uniforms, authority is displayed in subtle and interesting ways. The Deputy National Security Advisor takes an Uber to work to serve the president, who is chauffeured from various locales and walks through doors that are opened for him. Individuals such as General Brady (Tracy Letts) stride into rooms where everyone stands at “Attention!” until given permission to sit. When the top brass is around, the comfort level of their subordinates is subject to their desires. Though military service is often heralded as a selfless act, most of the powerbrokers in this universe make life or death decisions knowing their families won’t be collateral. However, a title alone doesn’t guarantee safety. In Bigelow’s universe, the POTUS (Idris Elba) and the First Lady (Renée Elise Goldsberry) are Black, and people of color are extremely well-represented at the different echelons of government. Despite this, it isn’t Elba’s character who’s portrayed as knowledgeable but the coterie of his white advisors. The adage “diverse faces in high places won’t save anyone” becomes salient, as it is primarily white men who are identified as designated evacuees and whisked safely out of command rooms. “A House of Dynamite” puts people of color in positions of power, only to undermine their authority and humanity, which is not helped by the film’s failure to provide these characters with fully realized emotional arcs. This film’s screenplay was written by NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, who is no stranger to dystopian and political work, having penned films such as “Jackie” (2016) and “The Maze Runner” (2014). Here, Oppenheim’s writing is effective, if somewhat redundant. “A House of Dynamite” shifts between characters’ perspectives, painting a picture filled in by different points of view. Though this initially enables the viewer to share in the characters’ confusion, the film loses its initial nail-biting momentum by Act Three as the film traces over the same lines rather than adding detail. Establishing shots and subtitles contextualize each location before Bigelow’s immersive handheld camerawork takes over, but keeping viewers informed of their whereabouts doesn’t provide a purpose for being there. Yet the film has its moments. Interludes of stillness are well-earned, and the moment when intelligence expert Ana Park (Greta Lee) is looped into the decision-making process is particularly arresting. In the scene, Ana has taken her son to the 162nd reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg. As she discusses the likelihood that the threat originated from North Korea, the sound of bullets and cannons echo in the background, a blunt force commentary on our nation’s tendency to worry about external threats while ignoring internal ones. It is sometimes a shame that so many details from our world are used in this alternate universe, as certain elements stretch the bounds of incredulity. Captain Holt is asked to provide a list of names and social security numbers in the event this escalates to war. Surely, a nation that operates one of the most advanced surveillance apparatuses isn’t in need of a document that would be incinerated by a nuclear warhead? When POTUS looks for his gold code card, he retrieves it from his pocket along with a few stray bills. “Does the president carry cash ?” is the first thing I searched after I left the theater. “A House of Dynamite” is a Netflix film. It was given a limited theatrical release before being made available on the streaming service, presumably to ensure it qualifies for awards consideration. However, it would not surprise me if this film is overlooked in the major award categories, as it poses difficult questions about the ethical implications of using citizens as collateral damage. It is not the kind of narrative that earns accolades, but it does provide a heartpounding viewing experience.

How to corner your MIA faculty advisor,"Humor, academic advising, Academics, comedy, faculty advisor, grad school, grad school difficult, haha very funny, humor, humorous, joke, jokes, major, mia, Stanford, thesis",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,Let's explore some creative ways to secure some much-needed alone time with your one-and-only. The post How to corner your MIA faculty advisor appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"Editor’s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious. All attributions in this article are not genuine and this story should be read in the context of pure entertainment only. We’ve all been there. You’ve suffered through the humiliation ritual that is cold-emailing every single professor in your department to search for an advisor, each consecutive email more desperate and sycophantic than the last. And eventually, you tricked one into sponsoring your degree-seeking project, and all seemed well. Then a few weeks pass — lifetimes in the quarter system — and you’re looking for some feedback on your progress so far. There’s just one problem: You can’t get in touch, and you’ve never, ever — and I really mean not ever — seen them in the wild. Not chilling in their office, not eating lunch somewhere weirdly depressing, not even outside wagging their fist at a scooter kid committing six traffic violations at once. But never fear, dear reader, for I’ve compiled an ingenious list of tips and tricks to help you corner that slippery sonuvagun and get your scholastic needs met. 1. Install a trap door in front of their office Now, this one might seem obvious, but there’s actually much to consider here. If they have multiple offices, you’ll have to install multiple doors for maximum coverage and make sure their cries for help are drowned out somehow. Maybe a cartoonish system of pulleys and levers that triggers the fire alarm? You can get creative. You also have to make sure to leave food and water in the pit (6’ x 6’ is best), most likely in the form of nutrient pellets and one of those little squirt bottles for guinea pigs. Make it feel homey, lay down a rug. At least then no one can say you’re inhumane (at least not by R&DE standards). 2. Send a fake email pretending their latest grant application was approved Nothing gets a weary academic raring and ready to go like cold hard cash, and I’ve seen many a tenured professor get downright reckless chasing funds. It may seem unethical, but remember: you’re a Stanford student. You can simply write ethics out of the equation, then lie about your character later. No problem! However, this option does come with some mild risks. You can pull this bait-and-switch off once, maybe twice before your advisor is legally allowed to commit physical violence against you as an act of self-preservation. They really don’t play when coin is involved. 3. Catfish them as a foxy undergrad in their area looking for a good time Now, now, this may elicit some understandable knee-jerk reactions, but hear me out. Think of it like a public service — if they fall for your ruse, you can post all of your DMs and cancel them on Twitter (Bluesky? Nah, Twitter), which, as a bonus, could free up a lot more of their precious time. You may also go to jail for fraud or extortion or whatever, but we’re talking about your academic career. You’ve got to do a cost-benefit analysis of the situation and come to your own conclusions. 4. Line the halls of their entire building with honey and extra-strength fly paper If they go to their office as much as my advisor does (never), you might find this tactic bears more fruit than #1 . In fact, you can catch anyone you want within a whole department this way. Use a long stick with a big, big net at the end to scoop up any unnecessary extras and trap them in an office (you’ll want to make sure you’ve already borrowed a key from the super nice/didn’t-really-give-a-shit night maintenance guy) so that they can’t alert the next wave of faculty walking into their fate. Don’t bother with the food and ambience in this one; department staff are scrappy and can work it out themselves. 5. Offer their children candy, kidnap them and hold them for ransom. I already know what you’re thinking: Woah, woah… whimsical Scooby-Doo traps and victimless cybercrimes are one thing, but surely kidnapping kids crosses the line? My friend, this is your graduation we’re talking about. This is war. And all is fair in the pursuit of diplomas and war. And some other third thing, maybe. If this seems daunting, study the titular scene from Liam Neeson’s 2008 blockbuster “Taken” for practical tips on getting the job done (as well as style inspiration). You can never go wrong in black! Less creative folks might tell you that you can just send an email and ask for their office hours, but everyone knows any faculty advisor worth their tenure checks their inbox once a month, max , even less frequently for emails from students. But these tactics, however “overcomplicated” or “legally distasteful,” have been empirically proven in the field to get results, guaranteed. Happy hunting!

When the neurologist works from home ,"The Grind, father stroke, healthcare reform, healthcare system, hospital, medical student, neurologist, neurology, ongoign recovery, patient care, Stanford Medical School, stroke",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"After her father’s stroke, medical student Nadia Kirmani was struck by the gaps in patient care she witnessed, prompting this testimony on how the healthcare system can do more. The post When the neurologist works from home appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","“Your father had a stroke.” My mother’s words came out clipped, with a foreign quality that was equal parts fear and disbelief. I had just gotten off from the hospital after a long call day on my internal medicine rotation. It was a sticky California afternoon, and I was parked outside my apartment, impatiently waiting for my exhaustion to wear off. My mother’s voice seemed even further away than the nearly 3,000 miles that separated us. I turned the word stroke over and over in my mind, a word that had once felt hypothetical, for which I drew up lists of potential etiologies and crammed treatment plans the night before exams. I saw it up close with beloved patients who unexpectedly lost the ability to move their arms or form fluent sentences overnight. Even then, I never could have seen it coming. ​​As I boarded the plane home, uncertain whether the man I had known my entire life was the same one waiting for me, I went over memories with my father with the same religiosity that comes with reciting a prayer you haven’t turned to in years. My father was taken to the nearest stroke center in our hometown: a for-profit hospital in the suburbs of Longwood, FL. As a medical student, I stared at the penumbra on his CT scan — the area of brain tissue that was reversibly injured, around the unsalvageable ischemic core — and I wondered how much viable tissue was lost because we didn’t know his “last known normal,” making him ineligible for a clot-busting agent. As his daughter, I looked at his brain and, tracing the folds on the screen with my fingers, I wondered how many memories of our family — growing up and old, through birthdays and graduations — had now vanished. What struck me most during my father’s hospitalization was the fact that when his neurologist saw him, it was over telehealth. My father was never seen once in-person by a neurologist during his stay. I knew from my training that certain neurological exams, such as testing cranial nerves, assessing muscular strength and evaluating reflexes, could not be performed through a screen effectively. The neurologist declared a diagnosis of global aphasia and proposed speech therapy as the only path forward. As my mother held my father’s hand — her husband for the last thirty-three years — she wondered if he would ever be able to say her name again. The day my father was discharged marked the beginning of a grueling recovery period. My father, a boisterous Pakistani man and former psychiatrist, was now struggling to name household objects and rehearsing American idioms, many of which he was learning for the first time. Previously, his livelihood revolved around language. It was how he climbed into the window of his patients’ minds to understand the context around their disease and their personhood beyond a set of symptoms. The first week was the toughest. “Useless,” he’d say, half anger, half pity. He didn’t open the language exercise book for another week. After a stroke, follow-up neurologic care is critical to prevent secondary complications. My father was given a referral for a local neurologist when he was discharged. The neurologist’s earliest availability was in six months. We were located in what I later learned to be a “neurologist desert.” It wasn’t just a consequence of where we lived, either. There’s a nationwide shortage of neurologists. A study by the 2024 Association of American Medical Colleges estimated that by 2036, there will be a deficit of approximately 37,000 full-time neurologists. Without timely access to specialists, stroke patients like my father face delays that can lead to devastating outcomes. A week after discharge, he was re-hospitalized for a five millimeter midline shift, a sign that his brain was swelling to a dangerous level. He spent another week in the hospital to manage his symptoms. On discharge, he had an appointment scheduled for the upcoming week — again, via telehealth. My father’s story is not unique. As America’s population ages, the prevalence of chronic neurological conditions including stroke, dementia and Parkinson’s disease is surging. Stroke incidence alone is expected to reach 20% by 2030. However, many communities lack even a single neurologist. Consequently, patients must wait months for follow-up and are often re-hospitalized in the interim, hospitals rely heavily on teleconsultations and families are largely left to manage rehabilitation plans on their own. Watching my father’s gaps in care as he struggled to regain speech after his stroke changed the way I saw the healthcare system. It made me realize that we need early and sustained investment in training neurologists to address our national shortage. As a medical student myself, I have seen firsthand how early exposure to a specialty can shape a student’s career trajectory. If medical schools introduce neurology earlier in curriculums and support students with incentives such as loan forgiveness, more trainees may enter neurology over more lucrative specialties. Most importantly, increasing the number of residency positions from a meager 1,160 spots and strengthening community-based programs would ensure families like mine are not left waiting months for in-person care. My father’s recovery is ongoing, oscillating between frustration and progress, with every language deficit regained like a feat that once seemed cruelly unattainable. His story teaches me that policy must take shape from abstract conversations into tangible reform that recognizes neurologic care as more than an afterthought. That way, when our loved ones inevitably become neurology patients, they will receive equitable, high quality healthcare — in person rather than behind a screen.

Reconnect Stanford imagines a campus without social media,"News, Campus Life, connection, deletion, Instagram, Life, loneliness, phones, reconnect stanford, social media, Stanford",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"At Stanford's first “mass social media deletion” event, the student organization encouraged students to begin their journeys of ""social media sobriety."" The post Reconnect Stanford imagines a campus without social media appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","“Toxic poison.” “Too consuming.” “My engagements were inauthentic.” These were some of the testimonials written on Tuesday night by students who gathered at On Call Café for a “mass social media deletion event” hosted by Reconnect Stanford, a student organization, committed to encouraging and supporting students through “social media sobriety.” By the end of the night, 25 students had quit social media and added their names to a growing list of objectors. They also received a free On Call drink and the opportunity to engage with like-minded students, free from the distraction of doomscrolling. “We are living through a loneliness epidemic, and no one is talking about it,” Emi Sakamoto ’28 wrote in her testimonial. Sakamoto deleted Instagram two months before Tuesday’s event as one of the earliest additions to Reconnect Stanford’s movement. “I’m ready to start practicing the principles I believe so strongly in,” Sakamoto wrote. For the founders of Reconnect Stanford, social media deletion is more than a pathway to being a productive or present individual — it’s a requirement for a healthy society and well-functioning generation, they said. “Our idea is, by the time we graduate, to have this campus be a place where nobody has [social media],” co-founder Ben Botvinick ’28 said. “I’ve never heard of somebody deleting Instagram and regretting it. I’ve never heard of somebody deleting TikTok and regretting it. It just doesn’t happen.” Co-founder Truitt Flink ’28 deleted social media a year ago and felt the positive impacts of her decision ever since. “I realized I was missing out on moments in my life, moments that were only being viewed through a screen or through a falsified version of them that I was later going to craft and post on my feed,” Flink said. “That mattered more to me than the real moment, and I didn’t want that to be the case anymore.” Eight weeks into her first year at Stanford, Allegra Bockhaus ’29 felt there was no longer a place for social media in her life, she said. Bockhaus deleted TikTok at Reconnect Stanford’s event. “I realized how many opportunities there are [in college], and I want to take every opportunity and live life to the fullest,” Allegra said. “I feel like social media holds people back from that.” Other students expressed similar sentiments, including Diya Bhattacharjee ’28, who deleted Instagram on Tuesday night. Bhattacharjee said that social media felt like a “cloud hanging over” her head, and she felt tired of considering how she was being perceived online. “My mental space is the most valuable thing I have,” Bhattacharjee said. “Someone else [online] is taking that away from me, and they don’t deserve to do that. If I want to live the most fulfilling life, I need to use my brain to my full capacity, which can’t happen when I have social media.” In speaking with students at Tuesday’s event, Flink and Botvinick found that most people dislike the role social media plays in their lives. Student testimonials acknowledge apps like TikTok and Instagram as a time drain and a source of anxiety. However, most social media users find a reason to keep it downloaded, whether to stay in touch with long-distance friends or follow news and campus events. Botvinick likes to point out to students on the fence about deleting their accounts that the ability to do those things predates social media. When she represents Reconnect Stanford, Flink said she doesn’t try to tell students what to do or how to live their lives. Instead, she said she poses a thought experiment: imagine yourself on your deathbed confronted with the way you chose to spend your life. If you have regrets or unfulfilled goals, imagine how that would change if you could get your time spent scrolling back. Reconnect Stanford aims to be “like Alcoholics Anonymous for social media,” Flink said. “We created Reconnect Stanford to empower people to continue making this choice every day and to be with people who have made the same choice, because that’s how addictions work,” Flink said. “You have to have a support network.” In the future, Reconnect Stanford hopes to have a row house for their growing community. They envision a space that fosters connection, where people engage with one another at all hours of the day instead of scrolling. However, leadership members missed the application window to establish a theme house, and the University only reopens applications every four years. As sophomores, Botvinick, Flink and other founding members will graduate before having the chance to apply again, but this has only further motivated Botvinick. “If we can’t have a house, make it the whole campus,” he said. Future Reconnect events in the works include phone-free dinners and parties. The co-founders of the organization encourage anyone interested in Reconnect Stanford’s movement to reach out at any time. “It’s very clear that this is something this campus needs,” Flink said. “We’re really excited to fill the need and welcome people into a community that’s devoted to real connection.” The post Reconnect Stanford imagines a campus without social media appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

Field hockey ended their season in disappointing fashion, men’s and women’s tennis qualified athletes for NCAA tournament play, women’s rowing had its first and only competition of the fall and home basketball games have started. Women’s soccer was the highlight of the week after they won the ACC title and secured a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Field hockey Stanford field hockey’s postseason run ended in disappointment last week when they fell 3-4 to No. 2 Virginia in the ACC tournament. Stanford’s goals came from freshman Summer Knight-Thomas, fifth year Maroussia Walckiers and sophomore Nadine Brenninkmeyer. Ultimately the Cardinal fell short, unable to make a game tying goal in the closing minutes. Men’s tennis Graduate student Alex Chang and sophomore Alex Razeghi competed at the ITA sectional championships in Berkeley, both as individuals and as a double. In doubles play they went 3-1, successfully qualifying for the NCAA Doubles Championships in Orlando, Florida from Nov. 18-23. Women’s tennis Freshman Alyssa Ahn went 6-0 at the ITA sectional championships in Berkeley, decisively beating Naomi Xu of Cal 6-0, 6-1 to take home the singles title. Ahn’s victory qualifies her to compete in the NCAA Championships in Orlando on Nov. 18-23. Notably, this is the second year in a row that a Stanford freshman has won the single section championship, following the win of Valerie Glozman in 2024, and the 13th time in the last 15 years that a Stanford athlete has won the tournament. Women’s soccer No. 1 women’s soccer played twice last week as they took part in the ACC tournament. On Thursday they played a semifinal match against No. 7 Virginia. After scoring three first-half goals, courtesy of sophomore Charlotte Kohler, who scored twice, and senior Jasmine Aikey, Stanford was able to hold on in the second half for a 3-2 victory. On Sunday, they beat No. 2 Notre Dame in an all-time classic ACC Championship match that ultimately had to be decided in penalties. Sophomore Charlotte Kohler clinched the ACC title with a sixth-round penalty kick. With the victory Stanford earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament and will host Cal Poly on Friday. Men’s soccer No. 2 men’s soccer also played twice last week. On Wednesday, they beat No. 15 Boston College in a 4-2 comeback win in the first round of the ACC tournament. In the second round of the tournament on Sunday, Stanford fell 1-0 to the No. 7 SMU Mustangs. SMU’s lone goal came off of a second-half penalty kick. The 48-team NCAA Tournament seeding will be announced on Monday, Nov. 17. Until then Stanford will return to The Farm to recover and prepare for the tournament. Men’s water polo No. 3 men’s water polo played twice last week and won both games. On Wednesday they beat No. 17 Santa Clara 17-9. Redshirt freshman Max Zelikov and junior Alex Gheorghe both recorded hat tricks in the game. On Sunday, the Card beat No. 6 Pacific 16-7 to close out their regular season home schedule. Sophomore Botond Balogh led scoring with four goals. The Cardinal will have their final regular season match this coming weekend, against No. 4 Cal in the annual Big Splash. Men’s swimming and diving No. 8 Stanford men’s swimming and diving had a successful outing at the annual Triple Distance Meet this week in Berkley. The Card ended up taking home eight victories courtesy of six different athletes on the day.

Rice discusses restoring confidence in American democracy in ‘Reimagining Democracy’ speaker series,"Campus Life, News, American, civil, Condoleezza Rice, democracy, democratic institutes, Larry Diamond, Stanford",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"In the final installment of the “Reimagining Democracy” speaker series, Condoleezza Rice examined the sources of distrust in American democracy and discussed how to restore faith in these institutions. The post Rice discusses restoring confidence in American democracy in ‘Reimagining Democracy’ speaker series appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Stanford Continuing Studies, a program that shares educational resources with adult students, hosted the sixth and final installment of its “Reimagining Democracy” speaker series on Nov. 11. Coinciding with Veterans Day, the virtual webinar brought in Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, director of the Hoover Institution and Senior Fellow on Public Policy, to discuss restoring faith in American institutions. She was introduced by hosts Larry Diamond, Mosbacher Senior Fellow in Global Democracy at the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) for International Studies, and Karina Kloos, executive director of ePluribus Stanford. The two moderated the discussion, asking Rice about how citizens and leaders can help reinstate public confidence in democracy. Before proposing how to reduce the stresses on democracy, Rice addressed the roots of declining trust in American institutions, citing waning confidence in electoral systems, civic structures, universities and even the military. “There is an across the board sense that Americans don’t think their institutions are trustworthy,” she said. Rice argued that this dissatisfaction stems from the belief that these institutions are not living up to constituents’ expectations. “When people elect their officials, they expect them to perform and be able to solve their problems,” she said. “[People pursue] circumstances in which they can build a fulfilling life,” which can lead to “a disappointment in the capacity of democracy to deliver.” She pointed to Congress as an institution in need of reform, suggesting term limits could bring “fresh blood” and new perspectives to the House and Senate, where roughly 20% of members are 70 or older. Diamond agreed, suggesting that the older age of many representatives might be hindering fresh ideas and adaptation to modern issues. “I don’t think the framers imagined you’d have members of Congress living into their eighties and nineties and still serving in Congress,” he said. Rice also emphasized the role of civil education in strengthening faith in democratic institutions. She called for a larger focus on educational equity, not only in higher education but also in K-12 schools. “The real force of mobilization, which is a high-quality education, is becoming class-based,” she said, which leads to “politics of resentment rather than a sense of opportunity.” In reforming education, Rice feels that there is an opportunity to promote public service. She urged the audience to find ways to serve, whether through the military, organizations like Teach for America or engaging with local government through campaigns. More than anything, though, Rice stressed the importance of being open-minded and willing to learn from different opinions. She highlighted two key practices for doing so: listening and civility. “Learning to listen to other people is important. You have to be open to changing your mind. If you aren’t open to changing your mind, we won’t get anywhere,” she said. Rice added that Americans have a responsibility to “engage in a way that is civil, that is respectful, in a way that furthers the conversation rather than shutting it down, with your fellow citizens.” Kloos, who leads Stanford’s Democracy Hub, echoed this, noting that civic dialogue is central to the undergraduate COLLEGE course that she teaches. “There’s lots of tools, including dialogue [in democracy],” Kloos said. Rice concluded by reminding the audience that democracy depends on the will and participation of its citizens. “Democracy requires each and every one of us to participate in it. If you aren’t active in your democracy, then you deserve the democracy you get,” Rice said. Despite the challenges facing American democracy, Rice expressed confidence that the U.S. system remains a model for the world. “Democracy is hard, and we’ve certainly had our stumbles. But there’s no better system that’s ever been founded than when humans have the dignity to choose who represents them,” she said.

Levin and Rice discuss challenges for universities in ‘era of misinformation’,"Speakers & Events, Campus Life, News, University, Condoleeza Rice, jim steyer, president levin, Stanford, steyer, trump administratin, university leadership",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"University president Jon Levin ’94, Hoover Institute director Condoleezza Rice and student leaders discussed campus political climate, free speech and the definition of diversity. The post Levin and Rice discuss challenges for universities in ‘era of misinformation’ appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","University president Jonathan Levin ’94 and Hoover Institute director and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joined a panel on Monday evening to discuss the current status of American higher education and campus culture. The panel, titled “The State of American Universities,” came as a part of the POLISCI 31 speaker series moderated by Common Sense Media CEO and professor Jim Steyer. The panel, which later included three current students joining the panel on stage, started with a discussion of Stanford leadership under the current administration, which Steyer characterized as “the era of misinformation.” University leadership faces “multiple concerns” under this era, including providing resources for students of all backgrounds and advocating for universities collectively, Levin said. “What makes university research different from company is the freedom here,” he said. “And it is this freedom that will make universities thrive for decades.” Rice argued that universities should serve as marketplaces for ideas. She championed Stanford and other elite research universities as the innovation engine of the U.S. Levin aded that while Stanford is out-GPUed by some of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley, the University will “win by people.” “The University does not have a private business model… We let people bounce into each other,” he said. Moving into the broader political climate, Steyer asked about the dual pressures on universities, touching on the “Columbia situation” — referring to threads on funding and free speech — as well as the Trump administration’s pressure on affirmative action, which forced some universities to turn over sensitive student admission data. “I don’t answer to hypothetical questions,” Rice said. When asked about what Stanford would do if targeted the same way Columbia and others have been, she said she “can’t judge on all these different circumstances” She added that she was “appalled” by the general lack of understanding of the Middle East on college campuses. She noted she had “worked hard in” the region, flying there 24 times during her time as Secretary of State. Rice and Levin also emphasized the importance of “other aspects” of diversity. Levin noted that the University has prioritized “diversity of opportunities,” with domestic students in the bottom 80% of the U.S. income distribution paying zero tuition and 90% of students graduating with no student loans. “Some of what has been defined as diversity… is actually exclusion,” Rice said, pointing to her upbringing in a highly educated Black family compared to the upbringing of an Appalachian child. “Would I feel uncomfortable on a college campus [as an African American]? It is not just about race.” Student representatives including Daily Opinions managing editor Jennifer Levine ’28, Joe Nail MBA ’26 and Mandla Msipa ’26 joined the panel to discuss the political atmosphere on campus. Msipa — who is a dual citizen of Zimbabwe and the U.S. as well as a Residential Assistant (RA) at Hammarskjöld House, the international student themed dorm — also asked the president what he is doing to protect international students in a climate where many say they do not feel protected. Levin said that while the University would engage in other actions to ensure the rights of international students, such as lawsuits, it would remain in full compliance with federal laws regarding immigration. “There is no way that this country would be the leading country of the world if it does not welcome immigrants,” he said. Drawing from her experience as an editor, Levine argued for the importance of encouraging the exchange of different opinions on campus. “Student conversation is important… Their opinions should be [ready to be] challenged,” she said. Msipa shared that he was grateful to see active political participation from students, pointing to the ability for pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli tents to sit across from one another for most of the 2023-24 school year “without throwing a punch.” “I just wanted to ask [the protesters], from which river to which sea?” Rice responded, stressing the importance of students “being informed” on what they are protesting. Nail said that a campus monoculture stops students from expressing their own opinions. The current ratio between conservative students and liberal students on campus is 5.33 to 1 , he said. He shared that a student he met at an event hosted by the Stanford Political Union — a non-partisan student club that hopes to fostering constructive dialogue — told him, “you are the first conservative I met who is not a fascist.” Levin urged the audience to question, “Why are we here?” He said that students come to Stanford to learn and challenge the orthodox, but it is also important to uphold the spirit of Ted Lasso: “Be curious, not judgmental.” The post Levin and Rice discuss challenges for universities in ‘era of misinformation’ appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was the keynote speaker, and a local Bay Area Vietnam War veteran was presented with a Quilt of Valor. The post Stanford and City of Palo Alto hold Veterans Day celebration, recognize Vietnam War veteran appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Stanford University and the City of Palo Alto hosted a joint celebration of Veterans Day at the David & Joan Traitel Welcoming Pavilion, honoring veterans and military members. Former Secretary of State and director of the Hoover Institution Condoleezza Rice delivered the keynote address. “Today is about recognizing the service, sacrifice and continued contributions of the veterans in our community,” said Zach Wright M.A. ’27, a former staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. The Stanford Mendicants began the event with an a cappella performance of the national anthem. Other speakers at the event included vice provost Michele Rasmussen, Palo Alto Mayor Ed Lauing, Commander of American Legion Post 375 Ray Powell and Donna Zolezzi, president of South Bay Blue Star Moms, a military family support organization. According to Rasmussen, Stanford has 36 undergraduate student veterans and more than 100 graduate student veterans. “We are grateful for their courage, their strength, for their valor and for answering the call to serve,” Rasmussen said. “Let us long remember the liberties we enjoy because they stepped up. Your service has made our world safer and our lives richer.” Also in attendance at the event was Vietnam War veteran Sergeant Manny Velasco of the U.S. Marine Corps. Representatives from the South Bay Blue Star Moms honored Velasco with a Quilt of Valor, made by executive board member Denise Dobrenz. Velasco called the gesture a symbol of “remembrance, care and gratitude.” “It’s a reminder that we are seen and remembered and we are still part of something bigger than ourselves,” he added. Zolezzi, who was a teenager during the Vietnam War, recalled how many of the men in her senior class were drafted through a lottery. She remembered how her classmates returned to protests and anti-war gatherings. “It wasn’t a very favorable war. They weren’t treated very well when they came back home, and many of them didn’t come back home,” Zolezzi said. “We try to honor them, welcome them home and thank them for their service because they deserve that.” It was this act of volunteering and sacrifice that Rice praised in her own speech. She also called for people to reflect on the progress the U.S. has made since its founding. Rice, who grew up in the segregated South, remembered the gravity of the moment when she was sworn in as Secretary of State, in the Franklin Room named for Benjamin Franklin. “Here is this black woman, child of the segregated South, taking an oath of office to defend the Constitution of America, which once counted her ancestors as three-fifths of a man,” she said. “That’s the American collective story: progress together. Progress through our institutions. Progress because we keep an eye not just on who we were and who we are, but who we want to be.” “It doesn’t matter where you came from, it matters where you are going,” Rice said in her keynote speech (Photo: ALANA BELLE M. TIRADO/The Stanford Daily). Rice added that she thinks this progress is possible due to the protection offered by the U.S. armed forces. Although America has periods of time where it “stumbles,” Rice believes Americans are united by the belief that “it doesn’t matter where you came from, it matters where you are going.” In his speech, Lauing paid tribute to his father, who enlisted for military service after the bombing of Pearl Harbor during World War II. According to Lauing, his father refused the mandatory two-year service, asking instead for three years, “because two wasn’t patriotic enough.” Rice and Lauing believe that the values of patriotism are still alive today. “I think about the greatest generation , who took up arms to defend a Europe and an Asia that were in dire need. But I want to assure you, there is a next greatest generation now,” Rice said. “And they believe that who we were, who we are and who we will become are worth defending.” The post Stanford and City of Palo Alto hold Veterans Day celebration, recognize Vietnam War veteran appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."

The Cardinal women picked up a win, but the men fell short against Cal. The post Stanford swimming splits wins in Triple Distance meet against Cal appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Athletes from Stanford and the University of California (UC) Berkeley met at Cal’s Spieker Aquatic Complex this past Friday for an annual Triple Distance meet. Consistent with the name, swimmers competed across three distances in one of six disciplines (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, sprint freestyle, distance freestyle and individual medley (IM) events). Stanford women’s swimming beat Berkeley 192.5-131.5, while the men fell to the Golden Bears 158-180. Swimming events from longest distance to shortest, those competing in the butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and sprint freestyle events swam the 200-, 100- and 50-yard distances of their discipline. Athletes swimming distance freestyle swam the 1000-, 500- and 200-yard freestyles, and swimmers in the IM discipline swam distances of 400, 200 and 100 yards. Olympian and redshirt-senior Torri Huske was the sole Cardinal to grab wins in all three of her events, claiming 27 individual points for Stanford in the IM events. Huske touched first in the 100 (52.64), 200 (1:55.13), and 400 (4:04.21) distances, beating Berkeley’s Mia West by less than a second in each race. Continuing their streak of breaststroke dominance throughout the season, junior Lucy Thomas and senior Lucy Bell split wins in their series. Thomas, Stanford’s primary breaststroker in the 200 medley relay, took home first in the 50 breaststroke in a time of 26.91. Earlier this year, Bell notched herself as the second-fastest 100 breaststroker in Stanford history with a time of 58.29. This week, she continued to chip at her lifetime best, swimming a 58.27. In the 200 breaststroke, Bell won handily in a 2:04.76, over four and a half seconds ahead of second-place Thomas. Also combining for wins in their series were sophomore Levenia Sim and junior Caroline Bricker in the women’s backstroke, and junior Jonathan Tan and senior Andres Dupont in the men’s sprint freestyle. Sim took home wins in the 50 and 100 backstrokes, swimming 24.61 and 52.67 to win her respective events. She also placed second to Bricker in the 200 distance, swimming a 1:55.57 to Bricker’s event winning time of 1:54.50. Consistent with most high-level sprint events, the 50 and 100 freestyles came down to hundredths of seconds. Tan won the 50 freestyle for the Cardinal, swimming a 19.45 to out-touch fellow junior Ethan Harrington by 0.07 seconds. Dupont, in the closest finish of the day, finished first in a 42.78, beating Cal’s Nans Mazellier by a margin of 0.01 seconds. Dupont also reached the wall first in the 200 freestyle (1:34.57), rounding out the sprint freestyle sweep for the Cardinal men. Sophomores Bailey O’Regan (distance freestyle) and Finn Harland (backstroke) both picked up two out of three wins in their disciplines. O’Regan, in a head-to-head distance duel against Cal’s Ava Chavez, won the 1000 (9:49.73) and 500 freestyles (4:48.44), touching first in the former by over 30 seconds. Harland took home wins in the shorter backstroke events for the Cardinal men, winning the 50 in 21.92 and the 100 in 46.97. Senior Liam Custer and junior Gibson Holmes picked up wins in the 400 and 200 IM events, respectively. Custer, in a convincing, three-second win over Cal’s Caspar Puggaard, touched first in a time of 3:46.06. Later on in the day, Holmes cruised to a first place finish in the 200 IM (1:45.70), beating Custer by two seconds. The senior was also the Cardinal’s top finisher in the 100 IM (50.67) following a disqualification from Holmes. Rounding out the wins for the Cardinal on the day were senior Gigi Johnson and junior Henry McFadden. Johnson, swimming the sprint freestyles, was Stanford’s top finisher in each of the three events, finishing second in the shorter pair and grabbing the win in the 200 freestyle (1:44.35) over Cal Olympian Mary-Ambre Moluh. McFadden, swimming butterfly, placed fourth in the 50 butterfly (21.88), second in the 100 (47.25), and won the 200 distance in a 1:43.10, over two and a half seconds faster than second. Also finishing highest for Stanford were freshmen Ella Jablonski (3rd, 50/100 butterfly), Ella Detter (2nd, 200 butterfly), sophomore Daniel Li (2nd, 200 breaststroke), junior Henry Morrissey (3rd, 200/500 freestyle, 2nd, 100 freestyle) and senior Zhier Fan (3rd, 50 breaststroke, 2nd, 100 breaststroke). The Cardinal wrapped the meet in two mixed-gender relays, with both A-teams falling short to Cal’s A-relays. In the 200-yard mixed medley relay, Harrington (backstroke, 21.34), Fan (breaststroke, 23.75), Johnson (butterfly, 22.91) and Thomas (freestyle, 21.66) finished second in a combined time of 1:29.66. The 200-yard mixed freestyle relay, consisting of Dupont (19.87), McFadden (19.39), freshman Olasewere (21.88) and senior Kayla Wilson (22.56), also placed second in a time of 1:23.70. The Cardinal divers will compete this weekend at the Texas Diving Invite (Nov. 13-15).

The post Week 10: Stanford in the NFL appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","Week 10 was one of the more eventful weeks for former Cardinal across the league — not necessarily with massive stat explosions, but with several clutch performances. The week featured a huge comeback led by Davis Mills and a breakout day in coverage from Kyu Blu Kelly. Even in a week without many offensive fireworks, Stanford alumni continued to make meaningful contributions in key moments. Standout performances Davis Mills ’21 (QB, Houston Texans) – Pressed into action after an injury to C.J. Stroud, Mills delivered one of the most dramatic wins of the week. He completed 27 of 45 passes for 292 yards, threw a touchdown, added another on the ground and helped engineer a 19-point fourth-quarter comeback, scoring 26 unanswered in Houston’s 36–29 win over Jacksonville. Kyu Blu Kelly ’23 (CB, Las Vegas Raiders) – In one of the strongest defensive performances by any Stanford alum this season, Kelly recorded two interceptions, two passes defended and an assisted tackle in a narrow 7–10 loss to Denver. His playmaking kept the Raiders within striking distance all afternoon. Colby Parkinson ’19 (TE, Los Angeles Rams) – Parkinson turned in one of the Rams’ most efficient offensive performances, hauling in four of five targets for 41 yards and a touchdown in a 42–26 win over San Francisco. Dalton Schultz ’18 (TE, Houston Texans) – Schultz continued to be a reliable presence for Houston’s offense, catching seven passes for 53 yards and a touchdown in the Texans’ comeback win. Notable contributions Michael Wilson ’23 (WR, Arizona Cardinals) — four receptions on seven targets for 34 yards in Arizona’s 22–44 loss to Seattle. Elijah Higgins ’23 (TE/WR, Arizona Cardinals) — Two receptions for 19 yards in the same game against the Seahawks. Thomas Booker IV ’22 (DT, Las Vegas Raiders) — Two solo tackles against Denver. Jake Bailey ’19 (P, Miami Dolphins) — Strong outing with three punts averaging 51.0 yards, including a 61-yard long and two pinned inside the 20 in a 30–13 win over Buffalo. Ethan Bonner ’23 (DB, Miami Dolphins) — One assisted tackle in the same matchup against the Bills. Justin Reid ’19 (S, New Orleans Saints) — Five total tackles (one solo) in the Saints’ second win of the season, a 17–7 victory over Carolina. Harrison Phillips ’18 (DT, New York Jets) — Four total tackles (three solo) in a 27–20 win over Cleveland. Bobby Okereke ’18 (LB, New York Giants) — Six total tackles (One solo) in a 20–24 loss to Chicago. Curtis Robinson ’20 (LB, San Francisco 49ers) — Two solo tackles in San Francisco’s loss to the Rams. Zach Ertz ’13 (TE, Washington Commanders) — Four receptions for 54 yards in a 22–44 loss to Detroit. Austin Hooper ’17 (TE, New England Patriots) — One target in a 28–23 win over Tampa Bay. Tucker Fisk ’21 (TE, Los Angeles Chargers) — One reception for seven yards in a 25–10 win over Pittsburgh. Kendall Williamson ’23 (DB, Los Angeles Chargers) — One solo tackle in the same game. Foster Sarell ’21 (OL, Los Angeles Chargers) — Contributed to a strong offensive line performance. Joshua Karty ’24 M.S. ’26 (K, Los Angeles Rams) – One of two on field goals (long of 48) and two of three on extra points in the Rams’ win over San Francisco. Christian McCaffrey ’18 (RB, San Francisco 49ers) — Recorded 12 carries for 30 yards and added eight receptions for 66 yards. By the numbers Former Stanford players combined for over 430 total yards of offense, more than 45 total tackles, six touchdowns and two interceptions in Week 10. Mills’ late-game heroics, Kelly’s breakout performance in the secondary, and steady production from Schultz and Parkinson headlined a week where Cardinal alumni made their presence felt across every phase of the game.

The post And So We Thought: There is a universe of ideas in ‘Invisible Cities’ appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","In “And So We Thought,” Daniel Xu ’29 explores creative works, both in their content, but also in how they relate to broader media and societal ecosystems. Editor’s Note: This article is a review and includes subjective thoughts, opinions and critiques. This review contains spoilers. Imagine this: It is a lazy Thursday morning on the West Coast. You’re lounging in some black leather chair with a rip on one arm, dress shirt (and maybe a suit, if you’re really into it) untucked. Just enough to still look presentable for the Big Guns. The croissant you nabbed from the office kitchens lies, two bites in, on a folded napkin. Steam rises lazily from your chipped coffee mug. You check your watch: It’s seven past ten . You frown. No one is late to a meeting with you , you with your Stanford-educated background that has allowed you to rise so quickly up the ranks of Google, or McKinsey or whatever corporation whose ivory tower you’ve ascended. Just as you stand up to leave, the subject of your meeting bursts in. He is disheveled, hair uncombed, wafting in with a touch of mint toothpaste he didn’t quite rinse out this morning. He is lugging bags and bags of artifacts you’ve never seen in your life. He wears a strange and unknown garment, splattered with splots of bright and blotchy colors. You rule an empire, with all of the wealth and prestige and authority that such a title entails. He is nothing but a messenger, an emissary, a tour guide through your kingdom of riches. And then the man starts speaking. You stare. Sit down. Endlessly. Entranced. And so you may begin to understand how Kublai Khan felt in the opening pages of Italo Calvino’s “Invisible Cities.” The Khan has tasked the wandering merchant Marco Polo with chronicling all the cities within his vast empire. And chronicle Polo does, painting images of a myriad of fantastical worlds and uncanny metropoles to the aging Khan. There is Euphemia, where weary merchants stoop to trade away memories beneath the eyes of the equinox and solstice alike. Anastasia, where the infinity of desire enslaves you to the frenzied creation of pleasure. Hypatia, where ships dock at the pinnacles of citadels, where graveyards house the best music. Halfway through the novel, however, we learn, as the Khan does, that Polo isn’t actually describing various cities across the Khan’s empire, but rather Venice — over, and over and over again. Each new city is a retelling of Venice, and all of the grudges, corners, street vendors and love affairs it houses. This is the central tension of “Invisible Cities”: How can the Khan, or us as an audience, for that matter, ever hope to understand Euphemia or Anastasia or Hypatia, or the cities Polo speaks of? And what of Venice? Even Polo, the chronicler, seems to have his doubts about the latter. “Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it,” Polo says. “Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.” As the novel progresses, Polo and the Khan’s conversations grow increasingly abstract. Do they sit together sipping tea, or are they still immersed in the bazaars and bloody battlefields, brought together only in the lake of the mind? Do the cities that Polo describes even exist, or can he only ever experience them as an extension of Venice? The Khan attempts to capture each city as trinkets on a chessboard, only to realize that at the deepest levels of abstraction; there is once more nothing left but wood and the color of the squares. One of the beating hearts of “Invisible Cities” is the treatise it drafts between the mind and the world. Kublai Khan, in his genuine desire to do real good, despairs at the notion of the infernal city. The Khan has, as Calvino puts it, “[arrived at the] desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy, sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.” The Khan, in his inability to separate this reality of empire from his ideal one, is constantly searching for mental metaphor — whether that be as chess pieces, Polo’s stories or his own dreams about an unburdened, unbloated city. Polo, however, reminds us that the purpose of the mind isn’t to change reality; it’s to discern it. The “inferno of the living,” as he calls it, is more than the Khan’s abstract fear; it is “not something that will be,” but “what is already here… where we live every day, that we form by being together.” The power of the mind, then, lies in the ability to distinguish inferno from that which is not. To truly discern what is Euphemia, or Anastasia, or Hypatia or what is Venice. This is what the mind offers us on a basic level. Perhaps more curiously: To find the newborn quince tree and liberate it from the rotting carcasses of its elders, to wander through the fields of desires and fears that compose a city, to find a pattern subtle enough to escape an empire destined to crumble. That is the power of the mind. Since its publication in 1972, “Invisible Cities” has become revered as a staple of postmodern literature. But more just standing as a masterpiece of a specific literary era, Calvino’s novel might be the masterpiece. Recall that when Polo spoke of the various cities, he was speaking of Venice, over and over and over again. On a very metacognitive level, the book itself is an inversion of that idea: When one speaks of “Invisible Cities,” they speak of memory. Of death. Of time and permanence and power and culture. Over and over and over again. The post And So We Thought: There is a universe of ideas in ‘Invisible Cities’ appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."
From the Community | How Club Sports’ new funding policy hurts women,"From the Community, Opinions, club sports, equitable, Funding, golf, SPORTS, women",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,Club Golf financial officer Araha Uday '26 argues that the new Club Sports funding policies hurt women more than they help. The post From the Community | How Club Sports’ new funding policy hurts women appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"I’m the financial officer of Club Golf, one of the co-ed club sports at Stanford. As a woman, I’m deeply concerned that Club Sports’ new financial policies for co-ed teams, which they claim will benefit women, will actually harm them. Since COVID, we’ve focused on rebuilding. Between 2023 and 2024, we increased our national ranking from 102nd to 43th place through hard work and inclusive recruitment. Our membership has also doubled because we’ve promoted our organization through equal-access venues like campus club fairs and social media. We don’t track gender demographics because we’re more focused on competing and improving the team as a whole. Still, two-thirds of our executive board are women, and one of our founders was a woman. Our female competitors are at the top of our club and easily qualify for tournaments. And from what I hear, our female members feel included and represented thanks to continuous efforts to expand across communities. However, the progress we have made towards inclusivity is now at risk. Until recently, receiving funding for Club Golf was straightforward. Every spring, each club team’s financial officer submitted a budget to Club Sports, which then applied for one large grant from the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU). In the fall, Club Sports distributed ASSU funds to its constituent teams in one-time deposits. Teams were responsible for managing their funds throughout the year to cover the costs of uniforms, tournaments and more. This year, however, that process was overhauled. Now, every individual expense must be pre-approved by Club Sports on their timeline. While that creates more paperwork, we initially thought it could be a positive change since it didn’t cap funding for additional tournaments. Then came the catch: Club Sports and the Stanford administration has now decreed that every co-ed team must aim for over 51% female representation on its competitive roster to meet Title IX compliances. Any extra male members must self-fund their expenses. To illustrate: if our competitive team has eight members — three women and five men — Club Sports will only pay for the three women and three men. The remaining two men must pay out of pocket. In a conversation with Club Sports, our co-president urged them to recognize a simple truth: golf, throughout its centuries-long history, has never seen women overrepresented. In fact, according to the National Golf Foundation, 28% of golfers in the U.S. were women as of 2024, a record high. Our co-president explained that it doesn’t make sense for our student-run club to be penalized for that broader gender pattern. They didn’t budge. Club Sports claims the changes are in the interest of women, but heading into my third year as financial officer, I never felt that Club Sports particularly cared about my experience as a female club sport leader. It’s more likely their motivations relate to budget pressure rather than Title IX. That would especially make sense considering that Club Sports also just removed funding for travel as well as for financial aid on dues. Since University-wide funding availability has been cut due to new federal policies, this new policy is disguised as a motion towards gender equality. There are a few reasons why it’s damaging to everyone, especially female athletes. First, it incentivizes gender segregation. The policy only applies to co-ed sports, which means a club could split into separate men’s and women’s teams to avoid funding losses for male players — but that would destroy the policy’s purpose. And unfortunately, a competitive women’s golf club would face difficulty establishing itself due to limited female participation and in turn reduced funding eligibility. A men’s team, on the other hand, would thrive, as there’s no shortage of male athletes interested in golf. As a woman, I don’t want to be excluded from the sport I love. And as a financial officer, I know a co-ed club team is good for financial and administrative efficiency. Yet, after cutting co-ed funding, Club Sports informed us that “compliance and proportionality is something [they] want teams to start striving for.” This new policy could push organizations to regress into what the policy claims to fight: male-dominated communities. Second, it advantages donor-backed teams and pressures unreasonable funding routes. Because the policy doesn’t forbid majority-male teams, co-ed teams with external donor support can easily sidestep these rules by paying for the additional male players, while smaller, student-funded teams (like ours) cannot. That’s just unfair. Additionally, our club keeps dues low to welcome non-competitive members from all backgrounds and skill levels. That accessibility has helped attract new female participants. But Club Sports suggested that we rely on unrestricted dues — collected from non-competitive members for recreational programming — to fund tournaments for the competitive team. Alternatively, they would have us unfairly ask a few male players to pay an additional hundreds of dollars. Inevitably, the costs will be shared by all members, including the women the policy claims to benefit. Third, the implementation was opaque. Our team wasn’t informed of the changes until days before our first tournament. If Club Sports cared about inclusivity, they would have collaborated with the female leaders of co-ed teams. They also would have communicated future adjustments and encouraged teams to start moving toward them, rather than imposing immediate penalties that left us no time to plan. For Club Golf, the prioritization of quotas over performance could undo years of progress by our leadership. I imagine that my team’s female athletes are not the only ones who are deeply frustrated, especially since the policy intends to create fairness and equality. If Club Sports genuinely wanted to promote gender equity, they should focus on the overall distribution of funding across sports rather than punishing individual co-ed teams. For example, creating and funding more programs that already interest women would facilitate equal distribution of resources. While I support efforts to promote women’s participation in golf, penalties at the college level can’t fix a systemic attribute. When administrators impose blanket rules instead of communicating with their student organizations, they mistake governance for advocacy. Equity cannot simply be achieved through quotas or paperwork; at the very least, it requires collaboration and understanding. Until Club Sports and our administration recognizes that, they’ll continue to hurt the students they aim to support. Araha Uday ’26 is the financial officer of Stanford Club Golf .

Dancing cheek-to-cheek: The romanticism of social dance,"The Grind, dance, La La Land, prince charming, social dance, Viennese Ball, waltz",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"As tempting as it is to buy into the romantic culture surrounding social dance, it is important to consider dance as a space for platonic community, writes Batts. The post Dancing cheek-to-cheek: The romanticism of social dance appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","It was 1:30 a.m., at the end of my first Viennese Ball . Having been unexpectedly whisked off at 5 p.m. the previous day (lured in by free tickets), I entered the world of social dance, dizzy and giddy. The hours magically whizzed by. This was my last dance before leaving, and here I was in the Latin room, doing the salsa. Then, with the last note, I was dipped, all the way to the floor. That is when I fell in love. I recounted this experience to my starry-eyed frosh hallmates immediately upon returning. My La La Land -loving friends were convinced that this dip was a sign, irrevocably, that this lead was smitten with me. For all of us, it was a scene straight from a movie. And who can blame us? I did fall in love that night – but amid the dizzying spins, I had misplaced my attraction. Many have uttered that love is a dance. I say, social dance is a love. After taking my first social dance class, I quickly realized that the salsa dancer was not my personal Prince Charming; he was merely a fantastic lead. He did make me feel like I knew what I was doing; he was very playful; he did make the night magical. My friends weren’t wrong to conflate it as romance, especially when related through my rose-tinted storytelling. All these characteristics are components of flirting … but also critical to being a fantastic lead. Little did I understand, good partnering in dance is like good flirting: You listen to your partner deeply, noting details, call & response. They go, I go … It is a good conversation, dynamically flowing. You let loose — have a good time — act playful! Tension hinders enjoyment … expressing individuality and creativity engages your partner! You are physically considerate and aware. You (attempt to) clearly express your intentions and then listen to see if your partner takes it another direction or declines! Psychologically, we link attraction with body language mirroring, eye contact, and open postures. Incidentally … all these are keys to good partnering. Now, there is also a cultural element at play here: the romanticization of dancing. Many Stanford students come to the social dance scene with this media-based understanding of dance as romance. Media, songs, and literature portray dancing as an inherently romantic activity, exclusively for couples or soon-to-be couples. There is no escaping the stretch of this narrative, as it ranges from Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina dancing with Count Vronsky, to Dirty Dancing’s Johnny teaching Baby how to mambo. Some might argue, sure, that Penny, Johnny’s life-long dance partner, was “like a sister” to him … but that was not the movie’s focal story. We bought tickets for a romance … to be swept off our feet and flown high. There simply are not many movies that emphasize social dancing as purely for sport, undramatized and de-romanced. But of course we love love! Platonic love is rarely the story we want to be told. The audience is drawn to dance as a vessel for a happily-ever-after with our OneTrueLove .  As an art form rooted in partnership, permeated with both physical and eye contact, any engagement is presumed to be a narrative stepping stone to romantic coupling. Slow dancing equals love, right? This works in stories, but what happens once we return our novels to the shelves (or, rather, X out of our Netflix account)? Can we have the same shorthand logic about dance in real life? As we may surmise, this way of thinking can quickly turn problematic. On an academic level, we can analyze these dance-romances for their anthropological implications. Our cultural psyche has onion layers to peel back: our storybook fantasies of romance, our gender biases against inter-gender platonic intimacy, and our interpretation of art (a dance) as the artist (a dancer). But why else is fantastical romanticism concretely harmful? If students expect lovey-dovey passion with each Lindy-Hop or waltz, then they will be guaranteed disappointment. Much worse, they could engage in unwarranted and unwanted amorous advances . This harms everyone’s enjoyment of Stanford’s social-dancing shindigs, and that’s no way to build community. Luckily, we can change this culture around social dance by setting expectations for a completely platonic sport, guaranteeing the emotional safety of dancers everywhere. The community at Stanford and the greater Bay Area is one of the most advanced I’ve seen in terms of communication around gender equality, mutual appreciation between follows and leads, harassment, and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ folks. The rest of the world still exists, though, and the romantic media narrative ain’t going anywhere — as far as I can tell — so we have a duty to educate newcomers to the community here, and an opportunity as we disperse the world over. Social dance is still an act of love. But rather than being romantically attracted to one another, partners collaborate on a love letter to dance itself, working together to guide the pencil across the page, tracing figures onto the floor. What works in flirting works in dancing, as these are universal methods of interacting confidently, considerately, and collaboratively. Now, let’s cut a rug and find the happiness we seek!

Liu | Democracy Day needs a higher calling,"Columnists, Opinions, democracy, democracy day, political, Stanford",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,"Liu argues that Stanford needs to engage politically during Democracy Day, and future programming needs to be more conducive to student activism. The post Liu | Democracy Day needs a higher calling appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","As President John F. Kennedy reminded us at his 1960 presidential inauguration, democracy has never been sustained by comfort. At the heart of every enduring democracy lies a single virtue: civic sacrifice — the willingness to give to your neighbor, the vulnerable and the public good. Last Tuesday, Stanford held its fifth annual Democracy Day , with events from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Arguments around turnout and campus culture aside, the event failed to live up to this virtue of civic sacrifice of putting others before ourselves. What should’ve been a day to call on students to take up causes aligned with their values, to disconnect from their busy lives on campus and answer a higher calling of serving our community, became a day of self-gratification disconnected from this very mission. A place like Stanford — so often isolated from the rest of the Bay Area, let alone the country — can be isolating and consequently, many students feel as though anything they do here won’t make a difference. But as professor Adam Bonica highlights in his Democracy Day op-ed piece, “In nearly every democratic breakthrough of the past half century, the spark came not from parliaments or boardrooms, but from campus quads, lecture halls and late-night conversations among students who refused to accept the world as it was.” Stanford’s own history of student activism highlights the indispensable role of students in these democratic breakthroughs. Therefore, you’d expect Democracy Day to be a continuation of this storied democratic tradition: Students taking action for the society, causes and institutions that we all care for. Moreover, at a time when ICE agents are separating parents from their children and half a million Bay Area residents are starving due to the SNAP cuts, Democracy Day should’ve been a call to action. But when I attended the day’s events as a panelist and participant this year, I was shocked to see how disconnected it was from this spirit of action. I kept asking myself, how does a button-making station or narrative workshop speak to the larger issues facing our democracy? Even my own panel, which was on the incredibly important subject of the First Amendment , lacked a call to action. Instead of talking about the First Amendment, I thought, shouldn’t we mobilize to protect the First Amendment rights of international students, who are losing their legal status because of their involvement in peaceful protests and publications? In fact, of the 32 events on the Democracy Day calendar , there was only one service activity: “Assembling Early Literacy Bundles.” The overwhelming majority of the events were panels (10) , workshops (11) and dialogues (8). If Democracy Day is about impact, shouldn’t the events center on service rather than speeches and participation over panels? Democracy Day deserves not cancellation or defunding, but transformation — one that directs its energy outwards towards a diverse and complicated country, rather than inwards toward an increasingly insular campus community. In other words, for Democracy Day to succeed, we have to get off campus. Concretely, rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars on free t-shirts, food vendors and guest speakers, we ought to use Democracy Day funding to take students to community service initiatives around the Bay and California, or bring those service opportunities to campus. These activities may include volunteering at a food bank (many of which are currently overwhelmed with SNAP dependees) or joining an immigrant advocacy group to inform immigrants of their rights and teach them about American civics. But there are those who say that we’re asking too much of students. If students aren’t already going to panels with celebrity speakers and free food and drink, why would they spend the day serving the hungry or helping immigrants navigate the legal system? It’s a fair question — full-time students already have enough on their plate. But democracy has never been sustained by comfort. It demands more of us, as Kennedy reminded us a generation ago: “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for a country.” Long before him, another American President, Theodore Roosevelt, inspired that same spirit in journalist William Allen White, who later wrote that Roosevelt “poured into my heart such vision, such ideals, such hopes, such a new attitude toward life and patriotism and the meaning of things, as I had never dreamed men had.” As the next generation of leaders, we must carry that energy and idealism forward into the next chapter of our American experiment. And to parrot the words of President Kennedy once more, we serve our democracy not because it’s easy — or for the free food and Democracy Day t-shirts — but because it’s hard.

The post Students to carry American flag from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, honoring veterans appeared first on The Stanford Daily .","While Veterans Day comes and goes for many, a band of Stanford students and recent graduates are going the extra mile to commemorate it. Or rather, the extra 145 miles: they will spend the day carrying the American flag from the lowest point to the highest point in the lower 48 states in one day. Co-organizer Joe Nail M.A. ’26 M.B.A. ’27, created the challenge to honor the sacrifices of American servicemembers and raise awareness for Team Red, White & Blue Inc., a veterans organization which promotes veteran fitness and facilitates the transition to civilian life. When the clock strikes midnight on Nov. 11, Nail, Alex Romano M.S. ’25 and co-organizer Adrien Richez M.S. ’26, along with five other students, a cinematographer, a support car and Old Glory, will set out from the lowest point in North America — Badwater Basin in Death Valley, Calif., at 282 feet below sea level. The team will then head northwest towards Lone Pine, first running the flag, switching out runners every mile. After climbing the ridge which marks the western border of Death Valley National Park, Richez will mount himself, the Star-Spangled Banner and the POW-MIA flag onto a bike for the descent into Lone Pine, at the base of Mount Whitney. From Lone Pine, the trek is entirely on foot, and Nail expects to arrive with the American flag at the 14,505-foot summit no earlier than 8:30 p.m. That is, if everything goes to plan. “Hopefully we don’t die from an avalanche,” Romano said, laughing. He was only partly joking: just two weeks ago, a hiker died after falling from a snow-covered switchback some 2,000 feet below the summit, and in January, another hiker died in bad weather. And with the ongoing federal government shutdown, Nail said, the team can’t rely on ranger support if something goes wrong. However, the team has taken many measures to abate risk. For one thing, among the five people planning to summit, three have vast mountaineering experience. Nail himself has summited Mount Whitney nine times and was deployed to an Army mountain infantry unit based in Colorado. All have prepared extensively for the trip. Aside from being held to Department of War fitness standards as part of their own military service, Nail and others did part of the route in August to determine even higher fitness levels to be expected of participants. Richez spent 11 hours one day last week climbing the foothills around Stanford on his bike. Additionally, the team secured backing from adventure racing company Spartan Race to provide specialized gear needed for the ascent. “Planning logistics was terrible,” Romano said. “We got, seven, eight people total, but we’re covering the 145 miles, and we’re covering different terrains too.” Still, the organizers see these challenges as miniscule compared to the sacrifices of those they honor in uniform. In fact, most participants are Stanford-affiliated military servicemembers representing all branches except the Coast Guard, though they noted that their expressed views are not necessarily those of the Department of War. Nail, Romano and Richez all come from families in military service, and they looked to the sacrifices of their forefathers as inspiration to join the officer corps. Romano and Richez matriculated into the U.S. Naval Academy straight out of high school and joined the Space Force and Navy, respectively. Nail graduated first in his class at the Army’s Officer Candidate School after graduating from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor’s degree in political science and Duke with a master’s degree in divinity. In the last two years, all three came to Stanford as Knight-Hennessy scholars. Nail, while noting that the Stanford community writ-large was grateful for and supportive of his military service, said he was unsettled by some early experiences on the Farm. “On my first day as a graduate student here at Stanford, the very first question that I got asked was how I could morally justify serving in the United States military,” Nail said. He said his concern rose when, at the height of protests around the Israel-Hamas war, anti-American slogans appeared in graffiti across Main Quad. In response, Nail, Romano and Andrew Fabela ’26, founded America Club, a student organization with the goal of reviving patriotic spirit on campus. In Nail’s eyes, part of that mission is building appreciation for those who serve in the military, especially veterans. “I do wish that there was a lot more of a focus by the university to recognize the people who have risked their lives to protect the freedoms that we enjoy and take for granted on campus,” Nail said. Richez added that his own pride in America was shaped by the gratitude his immigrant parents had for the opportunities the U.S. provided. “It’s funny, you know, my parents are these naturalized American citizens that speak with horrific French accents, and they’re just like the most patriotic people I know, and they love this country,” he said. “I’m very proud to be an American and serving.” Aside from honoring the sacrifices of those in uniform, Richez and his co-organizers hope that the Veterans Day Challenge instills that same pride in public service to younger generations at Stanford and beyond. “I just think a life without service to others is — what’s the point?” Richez said.

Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts,"Science & Technology, News, global health, Global Health Club, Global Health Fair, Opportunity fair, Stanford",,"Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:54:20 +0000",https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1280001,,The annual Global Health Opportunities Fair hosted on Friday night featured over thirty different opportunities and more than one hundred student attendees. The post Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts appeared first on The Stanford Daily .,"On Friday evening, over 100 students and local organizations gathered for the annual Global Health Opportunities Fair at the Li Ka Shing Learning and Knowledge Center. The Stanford Undergraduate Global Health Club (UGHC) and Stanford Graduate Global Health Network (GGHN) hosted the event in collaboration with the Center for Innovation in Global Health (CIGH) and Bay Area Global Health Alliance (BAGHA). The organizers of the fair aimed to provide a unique space to connect students with organizations that need more support. With recent challenges to U.S global health priorities such as the shutdown of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and stifling of the United States President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), “there’s a lot of uncertainty and fear about what the next step is,” said Hailey Ramzan ’27, UGHC vice president. “A lot of global health nonprofits, especially those on the smaller to medium-size scale, had to lay off many people,” said Max Zhang Yang ’27, UGHC president and one of the co-organizers of the fair. “At the same time, we heard from students that they wanted to get more involved in research and were fine with volunteering their time, even if it was unpaid.” Simply bringing people with common interests together can help kickstart such efforts. “[The fair] can facilitate an exchange of ideas, you can learn about what other global health work that’s going on, maybe research methodologies you’ve never heard about,” Yang said. Yang co-organized the event with Eliza Ennis, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in health policy, who is also a leader of the GGHN and a BAGHA Advisory Council Member. Ennis was hoping to support students by connecting them with global health organizations across the Bay. When she first came to Stanford, she was aware of ongoing global health research but unsure of how to find it. “I know as a grad student, I have projects that I would love to have an undergrad help with,” Ennis said. The event was able to feature more than thirty opportunities including on-campus labs and international non-profits with support from BAGHA’s connections with non-Stanford organizations, according to organizers. Michele Barry, Director of CIGH and Colin Boyle, Board Chair of BAGHA provided opening remarks. Students were then encouraged to walk around the room and introduce themselves to representatives tabling around the room. Yang hopes the fair can be a stepping stone for newer students to get involved with the community lifelong. “The key is to think globally and act locally,” Yang said. “Especially as undergrads, there tend to be more local opportunities but being able to address health inequities anywhere is really crucial.” Ennis, originally from rural New Mexico, agreed that there shouldn’t be a big differentiation between global and local health. She sees plenty of benefits of applying the same techniques and lessons learned in domestic rural settings to places abroad. The fair also attracted students and organizations with more non-traditional backgrounds in global health. Kushal Patel ’29 attended the event to find a mentor that shares his interdisciplinary interests across technology and health policy. He described global health as “not an industry, but a culture of social innovation.” Adeline Liao ’27 was recruiting students to join her startup Niora Systems, which focuses on developing technology to prevent systemic failures in medication delivery. “[Global health is not] just a space exclusively for non-profits, but systems that span economics and markets, private sector industries, and multinational collaborations,” Liao said. UGHC prides itself on being a diverse, wide-ranging club for people of all majors and pre-professional tracks, according to Yang. He believes this diversity in perspective offers students the opportunity to broaden their own horizons. “Even though I didn’t come from a health policy background, I’ve been forced to confront the fact that this is an integral part of making global health a reality,” Yang said. Ramzan thinks similar events can continue to promote awareness about a lack of accessibility in the wide varieties of healthcare systems around the globe. “I think global health is as much of a problem for us as it is for the people in rural Kenya,” Ramzan said. “It is our responsibility to leverage our position as Stanford students, or just anyone in the world with privilege, to uplift those who don’t have that.” The post Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts appeared first on The Stanford Daily ."
