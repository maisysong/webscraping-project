However, the team could not muster enough offensive firepower to overcome the Bulldogs and their aggressive pass rush.</p><p>Before kickoff, the team\\'s seniors walked out of the tunnel arm in arm with families and loved ones for Senior Day to be honored for their contributions to the program.</p><p>\"You never think it\\'s going to come until it does,\" senior linebacker Marco Scarano said as he reflected on the last time playing at Powers Field. \"I couldn\\'t be more grateful. I love this place and this program.\"</p><p>On the field, Scarano had a stellar performance, with nine total tackles. One would not have known that he had been battling an illness throughout the week.</p><p>\"I didn\\'t know until game time if he was going to play,\" Head Coach Bob Surace \\'90 said. \"I talked to him, and he\\'s like, \\'I\\'m not missing the game.\\'\"</p><p>On Princeton\\'s opening possession, senior quarterback Kai Col\\xc3\\xb3n was sacked twice in a row to end the drive, an early sign of how Yale\\'s pass pressure would affect the game. Yale went on to sack Col\\xc3\\xb3n six times in total, which is tied for the most Princeton has allowed this season.</p><p>On the ensuing drive, Yale was knocking on the door in the Princeton red zone. A pass to the end zone went off the hands of a Yale receiver before junior defensive back Torian Roberts tipped it into the air. While on the ground, Roberts tracked the ball and came up with the interception. </p><figure><div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Princeton 0, Yale 0 | 4:47 1st<br><br>RING THE BELL <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TorianRoberts1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TorianRoberts1</a>!

Once I tipped it \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 my initial instinct was to find the ball and come down with it.\"</p><p>On a third-and-nine after the interception, Yale brought heavy pressure. Col\\xc3\\xb3n stood in the pocket and delivered a 28-yard completion, taking a late hit in the process. A roughing the passer call tacked on an additional 15 yards to the end of the play. Though Princeton drove into Yale\\'s red zone, they wound up settling for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead.</p><p>As Yale breached Princeton territory on their next drive, Roberts rang the turnover bell a second time. He disguised the coverage look again before nabbing another interception to stop the potential Yale scoring drive.</p><p>Princeton then went three-and-out, punting the ball back to Yale, who evened the score at 3-3 with a field goal. After another Princeton punt, the Bulldogs followed it up with a one-yard rushing touchdown to go up 10-3.</p><p>Looking to get some points before the end of the half, Princeton made its way to the Yale ten-yard line. With 12 seconds on the clock and no timeouts, Princeton tried to take one last shot at the endzone. However, Yale again sacked Col\\xc3\\xb3n, causing time to run out. The Tigers lost out on a potential three points, which would come back to haunt the team.</p><p>Despite their offensive struggles, the team was just down by one score going into the second half. In an effort to find a solution to Yale\\'s pass rush, Princeton used a variety of quick screens and balls over the middle instead of taking shots down the field.</p><p>In the first drive of the third quarter, the Tigers again made it within Yale\\'s 20-yard line. Fighting for extra yardage, senior running back Dareion Murphy lost the ball, and Yale came away with it to leave the Tigers empty-handed on their second consecutive trip to the red zone.</p><p>Throughout much of the second half, the physical Tiger defense continually stopped the now-stagnant Yale offense, holding them to zero points and forcing three punts in the third quarter.</p><p>It was not until early in the fourth quarter that the Tigers found new life. First-year receiver Josh Robinson took a short screen pass 48 yards to the Yale 12-yard line, and Clark scored a one-yard touchdown rush to square the game at 10-10.</p><p>In response, Yale finally broke through Princeton\\'s steadfast second-half defense on the ensuing drive, settling with a field goal to go up 13-10.</p><p>But with three minutes and fifty seconds left, the game was not over yet, and the Tigers made it across midfield with over a minute to go. However, Yale\\'s pressure went to Col\\xc3\\xb3n yet again. After dropping back, he was hit as he threw, leading to an inaccurate pass that was picked off by Yale to ice the game.</p><p>The loss to Yale is the Tigers\\' fourth in as many weeks. It also marks the third game in a row in which Princeton fell short by exactly three points.</p><p>\"They left it all on the field,\" Surace said. \"It\\'s painful when you play these even games a few weeks in a row. We just got to get those little details done a little better.\"</p><p>Despite a near month of struggles, the players still see a potential light at the end of the tunnel. A win on the road against rival Penn could partially help close the season on a high note.</p><p>\"We have one more opportunity to send the seniors off the right way, and that\\'s what we\\'re going to do,\" Roberts said.</p><p>Princeton football will play its final game of the season at Penn, just an hour\\'s drive away, this coming Saturday at 1 p.m.</p><p><i>Jordan Halagao is a Sports contributor for the \\'Prince.\\'</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to sports[at]dailyprincetonian.com</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/c254f42f-634c-41bf-ae74-ed5dfc905a16.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Football v.

On Saturday, students remarked on the diverse selection of food and activities, as well as how the event brought cultural groups together.</p><p>Eleni Staikos \\'27, who tabled the Orange Panhellenic Association\\'s booth, described TigerTies as \"a way to bring the community together.\"</p><p>\"Everybody has been coming around and asking questions \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it\\'s actually been really exciting, and I didn\\'t expect it,\" Staikos told the \\'Prince.\\'</p><p>\"It was really nice to see all these groups come together - it\\'s really rare to have that happen,\" said Ruoming Shen \\'27, a co-president of the Asian-American Students Association (AASA).</p><p>\"There\\'s so many fun activities, and it\\'s really cool to see what each cultural group brings,\" Stephanie Ma \\'27, a co-president of the AASA, added.</p><p>This year\\'s event introduced a cultural fashion show in which participants showcased traditional clothing from their countries of origin. \"It was to show people where they came from, and that was a very nice aspect [of TigerTies],\" said Jeremy Bao \\'27, USG\\'s projects manager and a co-organizer of the event.</p><p>Villanueva expressed hopes to expand the reach of TigerTies to the broader graduate student and town community. \"In the future, it is a big goal of ours to have it become even more open to people from all over the community,\" Villanueva said. \"I really hope this becomes something that we can have happen every year,\" she continued.</p><p>TigerTies was sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (ODUS), the Davis International Center, and the Carl A.

Over 60 total attendees participated, including around a dozen former student government leaders.</p><p>The event began with a short opening address by USG president Enzo Kho \\'26, who reflected on the group\\'s history.</p><p>\"Tonight is not just a celebration of an organization,\" Kho said. \"It\\'s a celebration of the countless people who have shaped Princeton through service.\"</p><p>\"I think of all the students who will stand here in 2075, celebrating the 100th year anniversary of USG,\" he continued. \"I hope they look back on this moment and see a USG that showed courage over comfort, partnership over politics, and service above self.\"</p><p>Tom Pyle \\'76, the first USG president, delivered the keynote address. \"I have a distinct honor, I suppose, to be your George Washington of the USG,\" he said. He then read from a 13-page paper he had prepared for the event, noting he wrote it in the style of a junior paper \"to show you younger people that we still got it.\"</p><p>The paper, titled \"Energized, Enervated, Elevated: A Student Politico\\'s USG Journey (As He Experienced It 50 Years Ago),\" draws from Pyle\\'s diary and recounts his tumultuous time leading the newly formed USG.</p><p>Pyle originally ran for Undergraduate Assembly (UGA) president, the governing body that existed before USG. When UGA was deemed inadequate at addressing student concerns, the University transitioned to the USG model. Pyle shifted strategy, and his slate of candidates were all elected in the first USG election.</p><p>However, Pyle soon encountered challenges. Citing archived issues of the \\'Prince,\\' he recounted how a personal conflict with the Academics Committee chair led to an attempt to <a href=\"https://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/imageserver.pl?oid=Princetonian19750912-01&amp;getpdf=true\">recall him</a>.</p><p>In the original USG constitution, only 500 student signatures were needed to remove any USG officer. Pyle\\'s rival successfully met the threshold of signatures, and <a href=\"https://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/imageserver.pl?oid=Princetonian19750922-01&amp;getpdf=true\">he was recalled</a>. However, in the ensuing snap election, Pyle <a href=\"https://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/imageserver.pl?oid=Princetonian19751015-01&amp;getpdf=true\">ran again and won</a>, regaining his position.</p><p>Because of his USG responsibilities and political advocacy, Pyle said he spent less time on his senior thesis than he would\\'ve liked, earning him a B. He described a similar time crunch while preparing for the event.</p><p>\"I finished it about 11 today - just in time,\" Pyle told the \\'Prince.\\'</p><p>An alumni panel followed Pyle\\'s speech, moderated by alumni engagement chair Elisa Gonzalez \\'27. The panel consisted of former USG presidents Manuel Gonzalez \\'85, Zarnab Virk \\'20, and Dave Calone \\'96; former USG secretary-treasurer Christina Tan \\'92; and former UGA president Andy Strenio \\'74.</p><p>Several panelists led USG during periods of significant campus transition.</p><p>\"We had the Vietnam War going on, and, at that time, all of the males in the student body were liable to draft,\" Strenio said. \"We also had the energy crisis that year. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The campus was shut down between the Christmas break and exams.\"</p><p>Strenio spoke about the culture of student advocacy that was widespread during his term in an interview with the \\'Prince.\\' He encountered challenges with how to approach controversial speakers.</p><p>\"We didn\\'t think it was right to deprive audience members of being able to listen to what the speaker had to say,\" Strenio said. \"People that wanted to protest were welcome to go sit \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 They would simply stand silently and turn their back to the speaker.\"</p><p>Calone - the first person to serve two terms as USG president - navigated the early years of the internet on campus. \"By the end of my second term, email just rolled out across the campus, and I was actually given the right to email all the students,\" he said.</p><p>Amy Park \\'27, the current USGChief of Staff, and Angeline Yan \\'28, the Deputy Chief of Staff, led the planning for the event.</p><p>\"We only thought maybe four or five would come,\" Park said of the alumni. \"But almost 15 alumni came.

Hotchkiss wrote that \"The University is preparing guidance on the implementation of this policy, which will be made available well ahead of the Jan. 1, 2026 implementation.\"</p><p>The policy bars recording in \"any place where the individual or group involved has a reasonable expectation of being free from unwanted surveillance, eavesdropping, recording or observation without the knowledge and consent of all participants subject to such recordings,\" encompassing educational, residential, research and workplace settings, including off-campus University sponsored activities. It also applies to the recording of \"meetings or events that might otherwise be construed as public or open when it has been explicitly stated that recording is not permitted.\" There are limited exceptions for situations such as disability accommodations.</p><p>The policy was first raised and passed at the Nov. 10 Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) meeting. Though there were no votes in opposition, Genevieve Shutt \\'26 - a member of CPUC and a USG U-Councilor - abstained from voting.</p><p>\"Our campus will only become more insular and bureaucratic, and the majority of our campus will be excluded from important conversations and placing an undue burden on student journalists,\" Shutt wrote to the \\'Prince\\' after the meeting.</p><p>\"The University\\'s new recording policy will be implemented with an eye to maintaining existing media access and to supporting media accuracy,\" Hotchkiss wrote.</p><p>The policy has not yet been formally disseminated by the University, and several students who spoke with the \\'Prince\\' had little knowledge of the policy or its implications.</p><p>\"I would like to think that the University is making choices in the best interest of students,\" said Ify Obianwu \\'27, although she acknowledged she understood how the policy \"could be problematic.\"</p><p>\"I don\\'t know how it\\'s going to affect people personally,\" she added.</p><p>\"There is a need to protect students\\' privacy on our campus, especially during a period of uncertainty, and the increased surveillance of international and undocumented students in higher education warrants a recording conversation on our campus,\" Shutt added.</p><p>Grace Opong \\'27 shared similar concerns about the unclear aspects of the new recording policy. Though she has heard about the policy, she said she was not aware of any details about what the policy entails or how it was developed.</p><p>It remains unclear how the University will enforce the policy, which also bars the distribution and transmission of such recordings, or when the future FAQ page will be published.</p><p><i>Nikoloz Inashvili is a News contributor for the \\'Prince.\\' He is from Parsippany, N.J. and can be reached at ni5710[at]princeton.edu.</i></p><p><i>Please send corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/fa2683d3-813a-4fb4-9759-f92ff5e35022.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[7.

The incident began on Nov. 10 and was blocked within 24 hours.</p><p>The database compromised included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and home and business addresses, along with information about University fundraising and donations. It \"generally\" did not include sensitive information like Social Security numbers, passwords, or credit card and bank account numbers.</p><p>\"[W]e moved as quickly as possible to notify those potentially affected so they can be vigilant for potential phishing attempts,\" University spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss wrote in an email to The Daily Princetonian.</p><p>Hotchkiss added that \"the University, in consultation with outside experts, has worked continuously to understand the incident.\" OIT noted in an FAQ page posted after the breach that the investigation is ongoing and may take several weeks.</p><p>No suspects have been identified in OIT\\'s investigation, and officials have not yet determined precisely what information was accessed. OITnotified law enforcement of the incident.</p><p>The notification of the breach comes immediately after a widespread disruption that impacted printing and single sign-on, and other OIT resources beginning Friday. About 51 percent of \"affected servers and related infrastructure\" have been restored as of 5 p.m. on Sunday. Hotchkiss wrote that the service outage was unrelated to the service database.</p><p>A much larger-scale <a href=\"https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/11/penn-hack-documents-released-gse-emails-data\">attack</a> hit the University of Pennsylvania on Oct. 31. Individuals claiming responsibility released thousands of internal documents online, including donor records, confidential University memos, and personal identifying information for Penn students, alumni, and donors. The group claimed it had accessed data for 1.2 million users, although Penn disputes that claim.</p><p>The Penn hackers gained full access to a Penn employee\\'s account and posted samples of the data on LeakForum after sending mass spam emails to the Penn community. Penn reported the breach to the FBI, and the group has threatened to release or sell additional data.</p><p>OIT said they had no information indicating Princeton\\'s breach was related to that at Penn or \"any other incident.\"</p><p>As the investigation continues, Hotchkiss urged all community members to practice \"good digital hygiene\" by lengthening and regularly updating passwords for online accounts.</p><p>Chief Information Officer Daren Hubbard and Vice President for Advancement Kevin Heaney both warned the University community to \"be alert for unusual messages that purport to come from the University. No one from Princeton University should ever call, text, or email you asking for sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, passwords, or bank information.\"</p><p>\"We continue to monitor and improve our security efforts, reinforcing our already robust cybersecurity measures, including continuing to enhance training for all users,\" Hotchkiss wrote.</p><p><i>Haeon Lee is a News contributor for the \\'Prince.\\' She is from Brooklyn, N.Y. and can be reached at hl1389[at]princeton.edu.</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/9335c9cc-5fb2-4105-b957-70760bd13819.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Cybersecurity incident.jpeg]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>The Princeton OIT webpage </h5><h6>Haeon Lee / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/9335c9cc-5fb2-4105-b957-70760bd13819.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Women\\'s hockey defeats Providence in two-game nonconference series]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Women&#039;s Hockey]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[w-sports]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[sports-recaps]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Isa Mena ]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:41:10 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-womens-hockey-defeats-providence-twice-november-2025]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-womens-hockey-defeats-providence-twice-november-2025]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Princeton women\\'s hockey (6-4-0 overall, 4-2-0 ECAC) defeated the Providence College Friars (4-9-1, 2-3-1) in a two-game non-conference series at Baker Rink this past weekend. Princeton began the series with a 3-0 shutout victory and continued the momentum the next day with a 3-1 win.</p><p>The Tigers started out strong in the first period, outshooting the Friars and seizing the puck at every opportunity. Princeton maintained a persistent offensive front while successfully defending counter attacks from Providence.</p><p>Two minutes into the game, Providence had two close shots on goal, both of which were saved by first-year goaltender Lia Nevo. The Tigers quickly launched a counter attack; sophomore defender Brooklyn Nimegeers drove up the rink and took a shot but could not find the net.</p><p>Just over halfway through the first period, a faceoff between first-year center forward Riley Sorokan and two Providence players took place in front of the Friars\\' goal. Senior captain and forward Issy Wunder snuck in and stole the puck from the Friars, taking a shot and placing it in the back of the net, putting the Tigers in the lead 1-0.</p><p>But the Friars did not let up easily. Putting up a fight from the start, Providence played aggressively and tactically intercepted plays, creating several scoring opportunities.</p><p>For Princeton, it was winning faceoffs and creating turnovers that made all the difference.</p><p>\"When you\\'re in 50-50 battles, it\\'s a hit or be hit mentality,\" junior forward Ani Kozak told The Daily Princetonian after the game. \"So we\\'re gonna be puck first, and we\\'re gonna win those battles.\"</p><p>With the clock ticking down in the first period, Kozak stole the puck around the half line and drove up the rink to Providence\\'s goal. She hurled a shot and scored a top shelf goal, setting the Tigers ahead by two.</p><p>Tension rose in a scoreless second period as the Friars attempted to get themselves on the scoreboard. But the Tigers stayed consistent and made good transitions, maintaining their lead.</p><p>\"We have to play 60 minutes with good habits and details,\" women\\'s hockey Head Coach Courtney Birchard-Kessel told the \\'Prince\\' after the game. \"I think that\\'s the biggest thing.\"</p><p>Halfway through the second period, the Tigers had a series of shots but could not find the net. A Providence player intercepted the Tigers and, taking the puck up on the left wing, launched the puck at Princeton\\'s net. Nevo slid on her knees to her left, blocking the shot.</p><p>\"It was all instinct,\" she later said.</p><p>Friday\\'s game marked the 17-year-old goaltender\\'s first career start and shutout. Throughout the game, she made 20 saves for the team.</p><p>The competition increased in the third period as the Friars tried to come back, while Princeton fought to defend its lead. With nine minutes left in the game, the Friars were able to connect a string of passes to a forward for a shot, but it was blocked again by Nevo.</p><p>Princeton maintained solid possession for the rest of the game. With one minute left, sophomore right wing Mackenzie Alexander scored an empty netter, locking in the Tiger victory of 3-0.</p><p>Headed into their second game at Baker Rink, Princeton sought to assert victory again and beat a revenge-hungy Providence.</p><p>The first period began with intense battles and lots of physicality. With eight minutes left in the period, Nimegeers entered a competitive 1-on-1 with a Providence defender. Nimegeers slashed the Friar\\'s stick, receiving the first penalty of the game.</p><p>In the power play that followed, Friar forward Audrey Knapp drove past Princeton\\'s defense with impressive stick handling skills and slipped a backhanded shot into the goal, putting Providence in the lead 1-0.</p><p>However, the Tigers did not let this stop them.</p><p>Sending up numbers into the offensive zone, the Tigers pressed the Friar defense. Senior forward Jane Kuehl found the puck and passed it to first-year defender Catie Collins. Collins launched it to the back of the net, scoring her first career goal and flattening out the score at 1-1.</p><p>In the second period, the Tigers extended their lead. On a power play, sophomore forward Angelina DiGirolamo took a shot that did not find the net, but Kuehl was able to pick it up and send it in, setting Princeton ahead 2-1.</p><p>In the final moments of the third period, Princeton\\'s defense capitalized on a turnover and Wunder sent the puck up toward the goal. With a single second left in the game, Alexander drove it into the goal and secured the victory of 3-1 with another empty net goal, her second of the series.</p><p>The Tigers will look to build on this momentum when they face the No. 7 Quinnipiac Bobcats at Baker Rink this Thursday at 6 p.m.</p><p><i>Isa Mena is a Sports contributor for the \\'Prince.\\'</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to sports[at]dailyprincetonian.com</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/1402f994-15e9-42fd-93e4-94458a217478.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Whoc vs. providence]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>Women\\'s hockey will take on No. 7 Quinnipiac next Thursday.</h5><h6>Photo courtesy of Princeton Athletics.</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/1402f994-15e9-42fd-93e4-94458a217478.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[No. 3 men\\'s soccer tops Cornell 2-0, completing Ivy League regular season and tournament sweep]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[m-sports]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Ivy League championships]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Ivy League]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[sports-recaps]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Hayk Yengibaryan]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:35:52 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-mens-soccer-defeats-cornell-big-red-ivy-league-tournament-title-ncaa-tournament-college-cup]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-sports-recaps-mens-soccer-defeats-cornell-big-red-ivy-league-tournament-title-ncaa-tournament-college-cup]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>In a season already defined by firsts, <a href=\"https://unitedsoccercoaches.org/rankings/college-rankings/ncaa-di-men/\">No. 3</a> men\\'s soccer (15-1-2 overall, 9-0 Ivy League) added another historic chapter on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>The Tigers defeated the No. 20 overall Cornell Big Red (13-3-2, 5-1-1) 2-0, clinching the Ivy League tournament title and coming even closer to an unprecedented No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament.</p><p>\"It\\'s kind of unbelievable,\" junior midfielder Liam Beckwith told The Daily Princetonian. \"This past summer, when I was talking with teammates, we had high hopes for the team. We knew we were gonna be good, but we didn\\'t know we were gonna be this good.\"</p><p>With the win, the Tigers became the first team to win both the Ivy League regular season championship and the conference tournament, which was introduced in 2023. In its nine total conference games, Princeton has outscored the rest of the Ancient Eight 17-1.</p><p>\"Cornell\\'s a really good team and they move the ball well, they\\'re tenacious and have so many ways of getting dangerous,\" said Head Coach Jim Barlow \\'91. \"They were a little unlucky with their finishing today. I expect them to go far in the [NCAA] tournament.\"</p><p>The Tigers got on the board early as senior midfielder Sam Vigilante scored off a pass from Beckwith. The defining moment in the game came late in the first half when junior goalkeeper Andrew Samuels blocked a penalty kick from Cornell forward Kasper Wollstein.</p><p>\"If they score that goal, that\\'s a very different second half,\" Samuels said of his mindset in the moment. \"We know our biggest strength is our defending, so I\\'ve got to do everything I can to stop that.\"</p><p>As the visitors kept pushing for the equalizer, Beckwith sealed the title for the Tigers in the 88th minute.</p><p>Cornell Head Coach John Smith told the \\'Prince\\' that, ahead of the game, he didn\\'t see \"any real glaring weaknesses\" in Princeton. He added that the Tigers \"are physically mature and emotionally mature \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 they\\'re experienced and they\\'ve got good balance all over the field.\"</p><p>Next up for the Orange and Black will be the NCAA tournament. Upsets elsewhere -<a href=\"https://unitedsoccercoaches.org/rankings/college-rankings/ncaa-di-men/\"> No. 1</a> Maryland (12-1-3, 8-0-2 Big Ten) falling to unranked UCLA (7-6-4, 5-3-2) in the Big Ten semifinals and No. 4 Virginia (12-2-4, 5-0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) losing 1-0 to No. 25 SMU (11-4-4, 3-2-3) in the ACC title game - have opened the door for Princeton to contend for the top overall seed.</p><p>\"It just means one game,\" Barlow said. \"We just gotta win the next game, that\\'s been the guys mentality all year.\"</p><p>The committee will likely decide between the Tigers and the defending champion Vermont Catamounts (14-0-5, 6-0-1 America East) for the No. 1 overall seed. Regardless, the Tigers will host at Roberts Stadium through the NCAA quarterfinal game, should they make it to that stage of the tournament.</p><p>Weather dictated much of the first half. Wind gusts nearing 40 miles per hour made the pitch unpredictable and forced both sides to adjust on the fly.</p><p>\"It was a bit of a cagey start,\" Smith said. \"Princeton deservedly scored within that period of time.

The Princeton Pianists Ensemble concert was about to begin.</p><p>On Tuesday at 8 p.m., Princeton Pianists Ensemble (PPE) performed their concert \"Odyssey,\" which featured 10 pieces and around 50 pianists. \"Odyssey\" wove a musical journey through classical melodies, pop tunes, and more.</p><p>The pianists opened with a funky, Japanese pop-inspired melody \"City Pop: Greatest Hits.\" As the song neared its end, the pianists gathered around one piano, just in time for the final notes. It was the first hint that this would be a true performance, not just a concert, as the pianists regularly incorporated movement from piano to piano, physical gestures, and other instruments into the show.</p><p>The program included an eclectic mix of pieces, ranging from an arrangement from the \"Mamma Mia!\" soundtrack to works inspired by classical composers like Maurice Ravel.</p><p>\"Every piece brings something different to the table,\" PPE Music Director Brianna Dai \\'28 told The Daily Princetonian.</p><p>Despite the diverse musical genres and the lack of chronology in the program order, the organization wasn\\'t jarring. The pieces complemented each other, balancing more modern and upbeat pieces with older or more emotive ones, creating a musical voyage.</p><p>\"This concert is really about the journey music can take you on because each piece feels like a different stop along the way,\" Dai said. \"Some are nostalgic, some are cinematic, some are just plain epic.\"</p><p>Each of the 10 pieces (and the lively K-Pop inspired encore) in the concert felt \"epic\" in some respect or another. The pianists\\' mastery throughout the concert was also evident. It wasn\\'t just that some played entirely from memory, so familiar with the music that they no longer needed the score. It was the subtle nods to each other across the stage, cueing each other in, and the sheer joy evident in their smiles that made the performance so memorable.</p><p>For each piece, the performers combined that joy with technical talent, especially notable in the fifth piece, a hilarious and concentration-intensive rendition of \"Bol\\xc3\\xa9ro.\" This Spanish-inspired melody was originally arranged by Ravel. The piece began with a driving, light, snare drum-like rhythm. One pianist, Bedros Maldjian \\'26, kept that pulse for the entire piece as more pianists filed on stage and the music ultimately crescendoed into the finale. I was blown away by his concentration, as he kept the same tempo and subdivision while other melodies were playing, and even more so when the pianist sharing the keyboard was playing the piano in such an unusual manner. His partner at the piano, Anthony Coniglio GS, had the audience chuckling as he - also remarkably in time - played the piano with his head, his elbow, a pencil, and a tennis ball.</p><p>\"We just want to show that, yes, \\'serious\\' piano music and \\'fun\\' piano music don\\'t have to be separate things,\" Dai said.</p><p>I also enjoyed the third piece, entitled \"Your Name<i> </i>Medley.\" Featuring five pianos and a violin, the piece began slowly, then became more staccato for a moment before evolving into a beautiful rolling melody. Just as it seemed that the music could not become more heartfelt, one pianist stood up and began playing the violin, first adding rhythm and then taking the melody. Combined with the four pianos, the sound was rich and raw.</p><p>All the pieces were arranged and directed by members of the ensemble, which is independent of the music department.</p><p>\"That\\'s what makes it so meaningful,\" Dai told the \\'Prince.\\' \"It\\'s all about what students want in the club, because we don\\'t want people playing just to play. We want them to be playing and creating and investing a part of themselves into the work that we do, what we perform, and what we give to the audience.\"</p><p>The connection between the pianists and the audience was clear during the entire two-hour show. I particularly noticed it during \"Photograph + I Hear a Symphony,\" an intimate piece with a simple central melody that branched into something much more dramatic. The performers conveyed that intimacy with the audience with a hushed moment of silence before applause rang.</p><p>\"I absolutely loved the show,\" Lucy Park \\'28 said. \"It was a nice mix of classical and more contemporary and pop culture-like music repertoire \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and the encore was so cute.\"</p><p>\"Our whole goal is to make beautiful music accessible. You don\\'t have to be a classical music expert to enjoy what we do. You just have to be open to \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 feeling something; that\\'s what is important,\" Dai said.</p><p><i>Annika Plunkett is a staff writer for The Prospect, an assistant Newsletter editor, and a Spanish translator.

Here\\'s the 2025 winter lineup, ranked from what I am least likely to most likely order again.</p><h3>5. Mistletoe Matcha</h3><p spellcheck=\"false\">Though I\\'m not a big matcha fan, I couldn\\'t imagine that matcha lovers would want this under the mistletoe. Offered in both hot and iced, I opted for the cold version. The drink was described as a flavor combination of pistachio and matcha. My main struggle was the lack of sweetener. The pistachio added nuttiness to the drink, but it failed to counter the bitterness of the matcha. The matcha was lacking in quality and, despite the addition of the pistachio, did not have a complex flavor profile. Instead, the drink was overwhelmed by bitterness. The drink was quite milky, and the pistachio only came to the forefront in the aftertaste.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/6a660cbc-bcc0-4929-9082-aab749569a7a.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-d46cd097-20be-4217-bb81-df7a5a94788a\" data-image=\"embedded-media-d46cd097-20be-4217-bb81-df7a5a94788a\"></figure><h3>4. Cozy Cabin Latte</h3><p spellcheck=\"false\">Drinking this warm latte left me feeling cozy inside. While I enjoyed the Cozy Cabin Latte, it was missing the advertised notes of cinnamon and toffee. It was offered both hot and cold, and I chose the warm version. I tasted and felt the warmth of the cinnamon, but none of the toffee flavor came through. The sweetness of the drink was perfect for me - noticeable but subtle. The sugar balanced both the milkiness and the flavor of coffee. The Cozy Cabin Latte was sweet, but it was not an excessively sweet drink. The frothiness and milkiness of the latte were delectable and defining features of the drink. While a quality latte, it didn\\'t live up to its branding as a seasonal drink with a specific flavor palette.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/288bd2f4-57ab-4cb9-b921-c96de1b1b788.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-dddf1c73-827d-413f-87e2-8b11a2407351\" data-image=\"embedded-media-dddf1c73-827d-413f-87e2-8b11a2407351\"></figure><h3>3. Flapjack Flat White</h3><p spellcheck=\"false\">While this drink was advertised as a pancake-inspired beverage with a robust espresso flavor and real maple, this drink \"flat\" out tasted like coffee. The strength of the coffee and the sweetness of the maple complemented each other. Although the sweetness provided a deeper profile to the drink, the maple flavor was lacking. This is the only drink on the seasonal menu where I could distinctly taste the coffee.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/566660ee-c198-4d87-bd50-500b8572fae0.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-bfe785b2-961c-4b12-b5e0-a22ecb8ddbf0\" data-image=\"embedded-media-bfe785b2-961c-4b12-b5e0-a22ecb8ddbf0\"></figure><h3>2. Very Merry Mocha</h3><p spellcheck=\"false\">This drink lived up to its name and left me feeling very merry once I finished it. The chocolate component of the mocha was very noticeable, almost like hot chocolate with the slightest addition of coffee flavor. Advertised with a minty profile, there was a hint of peppermint in the aftertaste. The Very Merry Mocha overall had strong notes of chocolate. For lovers of coffee and chocolate, this drink has a pleasant mix of flavors. This is perfect if you are in the mood for something chocolatey but want a hint of caffeine and peppermint.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/422acafa-bdec-4ab0-877c-d23e3b060b13.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-7974ec3a-51c8-4e03-b399-edc0cd10ef1e\" data-image=\"embedded-media-7974ec3a-51c8-4e03-b399-edc0cd10ef1e\"></figure><h3>1. Fireside Hot Cocoa</h3><p spellcheck=\"false\">I would love to sit by the fireside and sip another one of these drinks. This tasted exactly as it was advertised and had the strongest connection between the description and the true flavor. Notes of standout cayenne and cinnamon were particularly strong. The foam compensated for a lack of whipped cream, and the drink fulfilled a craving for chocolate with a richer flavor than mere sweetness. The chocolate was not too dark or too sweet. I would order it again because it is truly a seasonal flavor enhanced by the spiciness of the cayenne in the delicious hot chocolate.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/6a4e6d28-59da-4387-a184-ff47388a22f8.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-f21d1379-4481-4ce4-bfee-20fbc37aaf87\" data-image=\"embedded-media-f21d1379-4481-4ce4-bfee-20fbc37aaf87\"></figure><p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><i>Eesha Sutaria is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2029.

His exit from the Senate this past January, along with fellow Democrat-turned-Independent Kyrsten Sinema, signaled that the bipartisanship these two centrists favored was a way of the past; upon her exit, Sinema remarked that, in today\\'s environment, \"<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/independent-sen-kyrsten-sinema-will-not-run-re-election-arizona-rcna124499\">compromise is a dirty word</a>.\" Knowing this history, I thought that Senator Manchin\\'s remarks at Princeton would center on promoting consensus amidst political division.</p><p>But the senator\\'s policy platform, like his ardent support for the filibuster and term limits, was not my key takeaway from the talk. More essential to his message was a conviction that he highlights in his 2025 memoir \"Dead Center\": public service is about serving the people, and political leaders are meant to represent their constituency, not themselves.</p><p>Manchin\\'s commitment to representing his constituents and ensuring that no American is left behind features prominently in the rhetoric of today\\'s electoral victors, including Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani. As students at an elite institution, we all stand to benefit from understanding how leading in a way that stands up for, and represents the interests of, every American is a winning formula that seems to resonate with Americans across the political spectrum. Princetonians of all political orientations, especially those who want to be in public service, should recognize that we share good-faith goals of representing the everyman, even and especially with our political opponents.</p><p>Donald Trump\\'s 2016 campaign positioned Trump, an economic but not a political elite, as an outsider who would <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/10/18/donald-trump-rally-colorado-springs-ethics-lobbying-limitations/92377656/\">\"drain the swamp\"</a> in Washington. Both of Trump\\'s winning campaigns <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/donald-trump-language-of-populism\">espoused</a> messages that resonated with the \"common man.\" In essence, the \"America First\" agenda is, at least nominally, about representing Americans who feel left behind by elite politicians.</p><p>And Trump\\'s success is only one example of the popularity of promises of authentic, people-oriented representation. Similarly, Zohran Mamdani spoke to New Yorkers who were struggling with the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-new-york-mayor-race-poll-mamdani-cost-of-living-change/\">cost of living</a>, promising that they were just as important as the wealthy New York elite. Mamdani, a junior assemblyman, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5444846/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-race\">rose from obscurity</a> to secure the Democratic nomination, a sign of the public\\'s desire for representation and their rejection of the political machine exemplified by runner-up Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>It\\'s true that left- and right-wing promises of representation focus on different people whom they consider \"left behind.\" Trump often targeted messaging to factory workers in the American Heartland whose jobs went overseas, while Mamdani spoke to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/02/nx-s1-5531004/zohran-mamdani-new-york-young-voters\">young voters</a> concerned about cost of living. But nonetheless, in true centrist fashion, Manchin\\'s message has potential to appeal to voters on both sides.</p><p>This people-centric brand of politics is not just relevant to, say, a SPIA major whose goal is to hold elected office. Princeton\\'s own elected officials can take notes from Manchin\\'s message. Undergraduate Student Government perhaps faces a greater challenge in that their electorate does not actively express such a desire for representation; many students are, at best, indifferent toward the actions of USG. So USG must determine how, with such a diverse spread of \"public\" sentiment, they can still serve as a body that is representative of student interests and earn the active support that may result from a more Manchin-esque approach.</p><p>In the real world, the Princeton degree comes with some baggage. Whether we agree or not, Princeton and the Ivy League are often symbols of elite power in the United States. Manchin\\'s message about the value of truly representative public service shows that, given Americans\\' recent attitude toward elites and support for promises of representation, it is incumbent upon Princetonians who hope to enter public service, whether through organizing or running for elected office, to prove that they are worthy of a vote.</p><p>In that sense, Senator Manchin\\'s message draws upon citizens\\' fundamental democratic desire for a voice. A Trump voter and a Mamdani voter are unlikely to find common ground on many policy issues. But regarding their end goal - finding representation - they align. No matter their background and no matter their identification with the ideological left or right, Princetonians who are engaged in civic service should unite around a shared goal of representation. In a polarized political environment, that glimmer of unity could be the common ground that brings left and right together - a fitting outcome of Manchin\\'s goals and a truly noble pursuit.</p><p><i>Ian Rosenzweig \\'29 is a prospective SPIA major from Bryn Mawr, Penn. who thinks that even the slightest bit of common ground is a beacon of hope for political unity.

Students were worried that their hard work might not always translate into an A-range grade (which, for Harvard students, occurs nearly <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/10/5/faculty-debate-grade-inflation-compression/\">80%</a> of the time).</p><p>I myself have been upset about a bad grade - on Sunday, I received a disappointing grade on a midterm essay I worked for hours on. But too many times have I heard stories about my peers bursting into tears during office hours, begging for a B+ to be raised to an A-, or wrangling with professors after precepts to explain why they \\'deserve\\' a higher grade on an assignment.</p><p>Princeton\\'s grading seems punishing in comparison to Harvard\\'s, so much so that the Crimson\\'s Editorial Board makes it the butt of their joke in their <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/11/10/editorial-harvard-grade-inflation-claybaugh-report/\">piece</a>: \"Princeton students seem to be faring just fine,\" they wrote in a recent column.</p><p>While it\\'s easy to make fun of Harvard for being easier than Princeton, a culture of academic perfectionism still clouds the words of any conversation about grading at either institution. For institutions like Princeton and Harvard - that will inevitably produce part of the next crop of leaders around the world- it is imperative that students are truly prepared and willing to face critique, hardship, and even failure. That starts with a grading philosophy that doesn\\'t immediately equate high performance with high effort. But it also involves rejecting a culture of academic perfectionism that places our self-worth hand-in-hand with a class grade.</p><p>Institutions like Princeton and Harvard house some of the most talented young minds in the country. Many of us will indubitably enter into professions or hold powerful roles that will help shape the nation\\'s politics, law, and public discourse.</p><p>In a world where high academic performance is reduced to a credential that parallels our self-worth, though, it\\'s easy to berate ourselves and catastrophize over what we take to be personal failures. Academic perfectionism is a prerequisite for self-worth - it justifies, we feel, our presence here. If we receive anything other than an A, we feel as though we were wronged - because effort and hard work have become a mistaken <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/grade-inflation-college-fix/684808/\">shorthand</a> for excellence.</p><p>A culture that incentivizes this type of negative thinking - combined with a grading system like that of Harvard\\'s - prepares us poorly for the failures we will undoubtedly encounter in our future. After graduation, some of us might go on to write books that are unexpectedly controversial, draft policies for hours only for them to eventually fail, or drop a developing petri dish integral to a research paper.</p><p>Our discomfort makes us averse to growth and change, and most importantly, accountability. Like an authoritarian dictator who crushes all dissent in the name of political preservation, we become allergic to anything that suggests any possibility of inadequacy. Authoritarianism demands the limitation of any kind of opposition to a central power. But only through a willingness to hold ourselves accountable can we accept opposition with grace. When we\\'ve been conditioned to see any failure as a parallel representation of our inherent deficiencies, any kind of critique is bound to be taken as a personal attack.</p><p>This is not to say that things like grade inflation or perfectionism produce authoritarianism, or that caring about a bad grade makes you a fascist. It\\'s more to say that academic perfectionism can dull our ability to recognize our own authoritarian tendencies because together they share a flawed reasoning that faultlessness reflects one\\'s value.</p><p>But when we condition ourselves to view academic accomplishment as a given based on hard work, we risk falling into the same pattern of thinking with our future professions. A position in local office becomes a reward for hard work, instead of a public-facing role where addressing disagreement, scrutiny, and shortcomings should be baked into the position. A role at a lab, a newsroom, or a firm becomes something we are entitled to as opposed to a place where failure is both possible and instructive.</p><p>While grade inflation and perfectionism might not directly create authoritarians, they can create graduates who struggle to hear that they are wrong and conflate any form of critique with a personal attack. If we cannot tolerate being imperfect on our transcript, surrounded by those who want to help us grow, how will we handle being wrong when the stakes are higher?</p><p><i>Siyeon Lee is a junior associate Opinion editor from Seoul, South Korea, majoring in History.

Cashman had facilitated much of the Tigers\\' patient passing. First-year Tabby Vaughan got the start against the Stags in her place.</p><p>\"The whole training yesterday she was hyping me up and giving me lots of love. I was really excited to play, but it\\'s obviously heart-breaking for Cash,\" Vaughan told The Daily Princetonian.</p><p>Despite the lineup changes, the Tigers turned on the gas to open the game. Not even three minutes into the action, sophomore defender Izzy Morgan found the back of the cage off an assist from sophomore midfielder Anna Faulstich.</p><p>\"It was awesome. It was a backpost goal - something we had really been working on,\" Morgan said. \"I saw Anna with an opportunity and I called to her.\"</p><p>Princeton comfortably brought the ball into the Stags\\' circle and beyond the 25 for the remainder of the quarter. No other goals were recorded after the first 15 minutes ended, making it 1-0 Tigers.</p><p>The second quarter started with a corner for the Stags, the first of the game, who managed to equalize with a simple pass to the edge of the shooting circle and a shot which was deflected into the top corner of the Princeton net. Without Cashman\\'s presence to protect Tiger territory, Fairfield\\'s offensive effort overwhelmed the Princeton defensive penalty corner unit, scoring a goal.</p><p>Princeton fans didn\\'t have to worry for long, however. With about six minutes left in the half, senior midfielder Beth Yeager connected on a drag flick to make the score 2-1.</p><p>\"\\'Step up defensively and be more aggressive.\\' I thought we were letting them [Fairfield] receive too easily,\" Head Coach Carla Tagliente told the \\'Prince\\' about her advice to the team during the halftime break. \"\\'Open them up a little bit more.\\' We were playing a bit too much ping pong back and forth. \\'Control the pace of the game.\\'\"</p><p>After the halftime recess, Fairfield came out fired up. Both teams would gather possessions, but as quickly as they would secure the ball, the other team would take it away. Neither team scored in the third, although Princeton was able to keep the ball on the Stags\\' side of the field for the majority of the quarter.</p><p>\"We all knew it [scoring] was coming,\" Vaughan said about the scoreless third quarter. \"I think we were all just trying to keep positive, keep the emotions high. We were getting a bit frustrated with each other, but we knew we could do this as a team.\"</p><p>With five minutes left to play, Fairfield took their goalie out of the game and added an extra field athlete into the mix.

The painting is a reminder of the longstanding history of Princeton and acts as a beacon for visitors of the Wilmerding Pavilion of American Art, asking them to explore and confront both the curated space and their ideas of America itself.</p><p>While the organization of the gallery can be disorienting at times, the pavilion is an intriguing take on the difficult task of representing the complexities of American history and identity.</p><p>While I had briefly spent some time in the pavilion during the museum\\'s student preview on Oct. 24, it wasn\\'t until my personal tour withKarl Kusserow, senior curator of American Art, that I truly digested it in full.</p><p>\"A hallmark of this institution,\" Kusserow said, \"is the kind of mixing up of works of art from different places and different periods of time to suggest different ways of understanding. This whole installation is organized around that kind of juxtaposition.\"</p><p>To this point, the pavilion attempts to prompt viewers to piece together the nuances of American history themselves, inviting discussions on protest movements, gender, and environmental justice.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/2363e604-973d-408e-90bd-0f7b363a4467.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-d85d16df-f839-4533-a195-848701967b70\" data-image=\"embedded-media-d85d16df-f839-4533-a195-848701967b70\"></figure><p>The first example of this juxtaposition is in the arrangement of the George Washington display. The famous painting that greets all visitors of the pavilion is flanked by two busts of the first president. One, is cast in bronze and was previously owned by Thomas Jefferson, while the other, made of a metallic mirror-like material, was created by Alan Michelson, a Native American artist. The piece, titled \"Han\\xc3\\xb6daga:yas (Town Destroyer): Reflect,\" was specially commissioned for the Museum. Made from a highly reflective material, the bust forces viewers to confront their own image and, in turn, Washington\\'s imprint on America. The bust\\'s base is made from a salvaged piece of ash to represent the burning of Native American villages.</p><p>When discussing the mistreatment of Native Americans and African Americans throughout American history, Kusserow said, \"We try, in this pavilion, to engage the idea that it\\'s not just a matter of victimhood.<br></p><p>\"They expressed their own agency in sort of combating a lot of the injustices that were inflicted on them,\" he added.</p><p>Indeed, interconnectedness is the pavilion\\'s guiding principle. Pieces that seem unrelated at first glance enter into conversation when placed together. For example, \"The Culprit Fay\" by John Adams Jackson is a sculpture carved from marble from Carrara, a region in Italy scarred by centuries of mining exploitation. This sculpture sits opposite a clay jar by Pueblo artist Maria Martinez, who gathered her materials from the earth after seeking spiritual permission. Together, these pieces illustrate the contrast between Western exploitation of nature and Indigenous stewardship of it.</p><p>Opposite this arrangement is a display with similar messaging, an arrangement of various still lifes from the 19th century. Hung in chronological order, the earliest painting depicts natural produce with an arrangement of peaches. However, as the chronology advances, nature soon gives way to the man-made, transitioning to natural products like cheese and champagne, and eventually to solely manufactured goods. This progression reflects a shift from harmony with nature to domination over it, mirroring America\\'s industrial and environmental trajectory.</p><p>In the very back of the pavilion lies the arts and crafts section,by far my favorite as someone interested in both textiles and ceramics. In a glass box display, there were several Tiffany glass designs and ceramic items, all in organic shapes that contrasted the manufactured approach of the time period.Some of the display\\'s ceramic items are classified as Newcomb Pottery, a firm that evolved from Tulane\\'s Newcomb College for women</p><p>During a lull in our conversation, Kusserow pointed me toward his favorite wall in the pavilion, showcasing two quaint landscapes: one of ships in a harbor, and the other a nameless marsh. While unassuming beside the Bierstadt landscape, these pieces emphasize the interconnected thinking behind the curation of this gallery. </p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/43102cda-7ae3-4d98-aedd-6a705fbd9bac.sized-1000x1000.png\" id=\"embedded-media-800ce1c3-0136-4858-a6b2-c55cf6f2d93c\" data-image=\"embedded-media-800ce1c3-0136-4858-a6b2-c55cf6f2d93c\"></figure><p>Another notable moment of contrast lies around the corner from the Washington portrait in the Libby Anschutz Gallery. Here, Renee Cox\\'s revisionist photograph, \"The Signing,\" emulates the famous \"The Signing of the Constitution\" painting, replacing the founding fathers with people of color. Just beside this powerful photograph sits the massive painting by Thomas Sully of Mrs. Reverdy Johnson, the wife of Reverdy Johnson, the lawyer of the slaveowner in the <i>Dred Scott </i>decision. The connection between the two pieces took me aback; it felt as though history was confronting itself in this little corner of the museum.</p><p>While thought-provoking, the displays can also read as busy and disjointed. I felt the logic behind the pavilion\\'s curation best revealed itself after taking extended time to linger on each work. While it is likely not possible for a casual museum guest to reflect on each arrangement in the American pavilion, it is a meaningful endeavor for those who take the time.</p><p>In the end, the pavilion\\'s strength lies not in seamless order, but in its deliberate tension. Those who take the time to read, to look, and to think will find that the pavilion offers not just a gallery of art, but a space for a dialogue that challenges, questions, and, ultimately reimagines the story of a nation.</p><p><i>Caroline Naughton is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2029.

The exhibition - borderless, eclectic, and cross-temporal - is located in the southeast pavilion of the new art museum, one of two main temporary exhibition spaces.</p><p>\"Princeton Collects\" celebrates more than 2,000 works donated to the museum by more than 200 members of the Princeton community between 2021 and 2025. Around 150 works are on view in this inaugural exhibition. From abstract Expressionist canvases to 19th-century British portraiture and Chinese earthenware, \"it is \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 impossible to impose on such sprawling gifts a single organizing principle,\" the pavilion description reads.</p><p>At first glance, the effect can be dizzying. The high-ceilinged room, combined with the lack of a cohesive theme or motif, struggles to orient the visitor as they enter. Immediately after a towering wall featuring donors\\' names, sculptures of all sizes stand at the center, with photographs of tattoos and oil paintings housed in frames big and small on the wall behind. Everything and nothing draws your attention.</p><p>The further you venture inside, the more messy the pavilion appears. Ai Weiwei\\'s \"Porcelain Cube\" (2009), an ornate three-dimensional ceramic cube, sits in the center of a collection of oil paintings. Nari Ward\\'s \"Scape\" (2012), a shredded fabric ladder, stands just around the corner from the cube.At every turn, you are hit with an amalgamation of diverse artistic media - fabric, ceramic, painting, and photography -<b></b>that at times feel overwhelming and excessive.</p><p>Even the positioning of certain objects - for example, a Qing-era Punch bowl sitting below an etching and engraving depicting William Hogarth\\'s \"The Gate of Calais or The Roast Beef of Old England\" (1748-49) - can seem almost arbitrarily placed with no concern for visual or historical continuity.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, however, viewers will see a deeper artistic connection between the two works.</p><p>As the punch bowl\\'s didactic reveals, the Chinese pottery showcases a reinterpretation of Hogarth\\'s painting. The two works, in effect, embody the circulation of ideas and aesthetics along trade routes that connected two very different worlds.</p><p>In these ways, moments of cohesion emerge from the exhibition\\'s apparent chaos as artworks reveal unexpected continuities across such an eclectic collection. Connections are made between seemingly disparate artworks, helping the viewer make sense of the visual commotion that permeates the pavilion.</p><p>For all its eclecticism, visitors enjoyed the diverse works of art showcased in the pavilion.</p><p>\"I like that the colors don\\'t match,\" said Elizabeth Watson of Ewing, N.J. \"The pieces go together, but it\\'s because somebody had a wonderfully fun time figuring out what goes with something else - I think that adds to the visual intrigue.\"</p><p>Amid the visual noise of the space, anchoring the exhibition is Irish artist Sean Scully\\'s \"Night and Day\" (2012), a massive painting of white, gray, and milky rectangles. Around it, tigers on ancient papyrus, porcelain deities, and oil landscapes draw viewers into fleeting visual affinities rather than clear narratives. Meanwhile, the set of Asian scrolls adjacent to Scully\\'s painting features works from 1761, the mid-1800s, and 2006, spanning Japan and China. These unexpected dialogues between time and geography lend credence to the pavilion\\'s description of a \"museum in miniature.\"</p><p>\"The collection is so big, and the way the materials are presented just keeps me interested,\" Watson said. \"Just keeps me looking, and looking, and looking, and exclaiming.\"</p><p>Still, \"Princeton Collects\" occasionally feels less cohesive than other pavilions in the museum; in some ways, its lack of a unifying artistic theme feels foreign within the broader museum, where pavilions are mainly grouped by geography.</p><p>While the exhibition succeeds as a study in contrast and cross-cultural influences, its spatial isolation raises questions about curatorial strategy.The thematic looseness - though deliberate - can leave visitors unsure of where to look or how to linger.

I can\\'t think of another museum where I\\'ve seen that,\" saidSherry Friend, docent at the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of Asian Art, during a visit to the museum.</p><p>\"The opening to the second floor of the museum is highlighting the fame of the museum, the fame of Princeton, and the caliber of art that they\\'re able to collect with their means,\" said Madison Anderson \\'27, an art history major and former member of the museum\\'s Student Advisory Board.</p><p>\"Some galleries also serve as circulation spaces, we don\\'t see any of the gallery spaces in the building as \\'hallways,\\'\" said Art Museum spokesperson Morgan Gengo.</p><p>Rather than simply connecting one gallery to the next, the circulation spaces present visitors with an unpredictable and diverse array of pieces.<b> </b>Tall glass cases above the Grand Hall, for instance, house a dizzying array of bowls, vases, and objects from a broad array of cultures.<b></b>Meanwhile, the Cross-Collections Gallery, located just outside of the Asian Art Pavilion, builds Josiah McElheny\\'s \"A Twilight Labyrinth (Alchemy)\" (2019) into a wall near a Spanish alabaster carving of a knight from circa 1500.</p><p>But unlike areas like American, modern, and ancient Mediterranean art, which have dedicated pavilions, the museum\\'s African and Latin American art is largely showcased in the hallways.</p><p>\"The museum, I know for a fact, has a very strong Latin American art collection \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and the Latin American Gallery of Art is quite literally a corner,\" Anderson told the \\'Prince.\\'<b></b><b></b></p><p>Perrin LathropGS \\'21, Associate Curator of African Art at the museum, wrote in a statement that the \"interstitial galleries emphasize ideas of cultural contact and exchange.\" African and Latin American art galleries \"are present throughout the museum and are inescapable,\" she added.</p><p>\"You can\\'t escape the fact that there will be art in that hallway,\" Anderson said. \"You\\'re going to have to pass by it, so why not look?\"</p><p>Before the museum\\'s renovation, European, American, and contemporary art dominated the main upstairs floor, while non-Western art was placed in the downstairs galleries, where there were fewer visitors.</p><p>\"The new museum, by putting art on the same physical level, helps convey that all art is important, it\\'s valuable,\" said Annemarie Iker GS \\'24, a scholar of modern art.</p><p>\"The African art galleries have increased in size by some 700% from the previous building and are strategically located adjacent to the galleries for art of the Islamic world and the ancient Mediterranean,\" Lathrop added.</p><p>Many of the pieces on display in the African art collection are attributed to an \"Artist unrecorded,\" a label that Lathrop wrote \"recognizes the individuality of the person who created the work, before providing information about their culture and geographic origin.\"</p><p>The attribution \"serves as a corrective to the ways that the international circulation of their work, especially during the colonial era, erased their individuality,\" Lathrop wrote.</p><p>Similarly, the Latin American and North Native American art galleries, located by the entrance to the American art pavilion, include many ceramic figures, vessels, and objects by artists that are unidentified, such as the \"Model yaakw (canoe)\" (before 1882). Most modern art from the cultures showcased in the transition spaces, however, is located in the Modern and Contemporary art pavilion.</p><p>\"I\\'m not sure how much of this at the time people would have thought of as art,\" Friend said, adding that the frequency of unnamed artists for certain cultures may be a consequence of the blurred line between art and product.</p><p>From iconic paintings of mythological and historical scenes to obscure Attic  and ceramic Olmec pottery, the museum\\'s transitional spaces have much to offer. Despite not having their own dedicated pavilions, the African, South Asian, Native North American, and Latin American art scattered across the museum\\'s second-floor galleries provides visitors with the opportunity to learn about the cultural histories, traditions, and identities of artists from around the world.</p><p><i>Haeon Lee is a News contributor for the \\'Prince.\\' She is from Brooklyn, N.Y. and can be reached at hl1389[at]princeton.edu.</i></p><p><i>Amaya Taylor is a News contributor for the \\'Prince.\\' She is from Memphis, Tenn. and can be reached at at9074[at]princeton.edu.</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/c04eeeb1-c449-4fe1-9918-736f3aca616a.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Death of Socrates (David, after 1787) and Nelson&#039;s Jacket and Fanny&#039;s Dress (Shonibare, 2011) from above - MC McCoy (10_25_25).JPG]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>A hallway on the main floor of the Princeton University Art Museum. </h5><h6>MC McCoy / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/c04eeeb1-c449-4fe1-9918-736f3aca616a.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Princeton University Art Museum: By the Numbers]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[data]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Princeton University Art Museum]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Aayush Mitra]]></author>\\n            <author><![CDATA[Vincent Etherton]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:49:05 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-data-university-art-museum-by-the-numbers]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-data-university-art-museum-by-the-numbers]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>After nearly five years of renovations, the Princeton University Art Museum has reopened, showcasing more than 3,000 pieces from a collection of over 50,000. Featuring household names like Monet and Warhol alongside works from more obscure or even unidentified artists, the data reveals a varied curation across over 500 artists and 1,000 distinct artistic mediums in Princeton\\'s newly renewed public art experience.</p><p>The Daily Princetonian analyzed trends from the<a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/search?sort=relevance&amp;from=0&amp;onView=true\"> art museum collections database</a>, focusing on the 3,241 artworks currently on display out of 58,348 total in the database.</p><p>Where the data was consistently formatted, the \\'Prince\\' used simple text-analysis machine learning (ML) techniques - <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-tokenization\">word tokenization</a> (breaking text into words or phrases) and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview\">clustering</a> (grouping similar items based on shared features) - to organize the mediums and dates of works into broader categories.</p><p>The art museum opened to the public on Halloween, drawing more than 20,000 visitors over a 24-hour opening event.</p><p><b>Artists</b></p><figure><div class=\"embed-code\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/26085282\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26085282/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /></noscript></div></div></figure><p>The \\'Prince\\' first looked at a breakdown of credited artists on display at the art museum.

The score compares an artist\\'s number of monthly searches to Toshiko Takaezu, former Princeton art professor and creator of \"Dialogues in Clay,\" the welcome exhibit to the museum.</p><p>Andy Warhol, Claude Monet, and Benjamin West hold the top three Bosworth Art scores, averaging roughly 84, 80, and 78 respectively for 2024. This means that each of these artists were searched about 80 times more often than Takaezu.</p><p>By this metric, seven of the fifteen most recognizable artists are painters and four are photographers or print artists.</p><p><b>Mediums</b></p><p>The original dataset from the art museum\\'s collection search included 1,084 different art mediums. To make these easier to study, the \\'Prince\\' used a machine learning <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/k-means-clustering?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">technique</a> called k-means clustering to group similar mediums into broader categories to analyze.</p><p>The original 1,084 medium entries were grouped into 40 broader categories, chosen using common data science methods to capture meaningful differences between mediums while keeping the categories simple enough to interpret.</p><figure><div class=\"embed-code\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/26099214\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26099214/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /></noscript></div></div></figure><p>More than 240 works were categorized as either <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/black-figure-pottery\">\"black-figure\"</a> or general ceramics.

About two thirds of all works have some shade of gray or beige as their average color - categorized into clusters representing the colors stone gray, ash brown, beige gray, and light sand. Golden tan, a smaller group of 253 works, has a yellow/gold average color, representing many of the images of clay sculptures. The smallest group, slate blue, is a blue-gray color and contains many of the more colorful and modern works on display at the museum.</p><p>The \\'Prince\\' also analyzed the relative brightness, saturation, and vibrance of works using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) codes. This was broken down by the ten most frequent cultural clusters, identified using k-means clustering.</p><figure><div class=\"embed-code\"><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/26098987\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26098987/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /></noscript></div></div></figure><p>Most of the artistic cultural groups had similar brightness levels, with Roman works falling below the average by 5.3 percent and works in the Greek (other) category having 7.1 percent higher brightness levels than average.</p><p>Olmec art, recognized for its <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/olmec-world-ritual-and-rulership\">stone sculptures</a> and expressive human features, shows a 36.5 percent higher saturation than average. Etruscan art, known for its terracotta sculptures and <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/objects/16300\">ornate pottery</a>, has a 15.3 percent higher saturation than average. In contrast, Japanese works, Egyptian works, and Non-Attic Greek works register about 10 percent lower saturation scores, suggesting subtler or more restrained palettes.</p><p>Differences in vibrance values are more moderate, with Chinese, Roman, Japanese, Maya, Nasca, and Olmec artwork being close to average in value. Notably, Etruscan works have a vibrance value 17.5 percent higher than average, while Egyptian works have a value about 10 percent lower than average.</p><p>The reopening marks an invitation to examine only a snippet of Princeton\\'s collections. By the numbers, the museum\\'s collection is vast and complex, hailing from many time periods and regions throughout human history.</p><p>All visitors are able to visit the Princeton University Art Museum\\'s collection of over 3,000 works for no cost.</p><p><i>Vincent Etherton is a head Data editor for the \\'Prince.\\'</i></p><p><i>Aayush Mitra is a contributing Data writer for the \\'Prince.\\'</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/b339a386-f69b-440c-a312-7f11f94bda47.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Portraits (NEF) - Katharine Shea.jpg]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>A wall of portraits in the Princeton University Art Museum.</h5><h6>Katharine Shea / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/b339a386-f69b-440c-a312-7f11f94bda47.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[How the new art museum confronts its \\'problematic\\' past]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Features]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Nikki Han]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:46:36 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-features-art-museum-renovation-layout]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-features-art-museum-renovation-layout]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Before its demolition in 2021, Director of the Princeton University Art Museum James Steward <a href=\"https://paw.princeton.edu/article/princeton-university-art-museum-everybody-needs-kind-pause-give-it-chance\">called</a> the museum\\'s layout \"problematic\" during a 2020 online presentation.</p><p>European, American, and contemporary art dominated the main floor galleries, while non-Western art was relegated to the downstairs galleries. According to Steward\\'s new book \"Renaissance: A New Museum for Princeton,\" around 40 percent of visitors to the art museum never went downstairs.</p><p>\"It definitely imposed a sense of hierarchy,\" Michael Zhang GS \\'25, who recently completed a Ph.D. in African Art, told The Daily Princetonian. \"You felt this sense of grandeur when you walked in, and then you finished walking through the galleries on the first floor, and you had to go down to the basement where the African art and Asian art collection was.\"</p><p>\"People had to go downstairs, and it felt like a basement,\" Senior Associate Director for Collections and Exhibitions Chris Newth said earlier this semester during an early tour of the museum.</p><p>The newly renovated museum tackles the problem of Eurocentricity head on, with an open layout to encourage visitor circulation between seven art pavilions, intentional juxtaposition of geographically and temporally disparate artworks, and placing artwork in the context it was first made to be viewed.</p><p>But with the noticeable lack of a pavilion dedicated to African Art and uncertain provenance still haunting many non-Western pieces, questions <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/22af5c81-f01e-4f24-8270-8f179e3157d4\">remain </a>over whether the new museum has been successful in its <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/visit/new-museum#\">mission</a> to \"challeng[e] the traditional hierarchies inherent in multilevel gallery display.\"</p><h2>The old art museum</h2><p>When the old art museum was initially constructed in 1966, the gradual nature of its expansion produced a building which had hierarchy inscribed onto its very structure.</p><p>It was only after renovations between 1986 and 1989 that the museum even <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/afar/article/52/1/72/55084/African-Arts-at-the-Princeton-University-Art\">installed</a> a permanent African gallery in its lower level. According to a 1989 <a href=\"https://papersofprinceton.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19891005-01.2.25&amp;srpos=29&amp;e=------198-en-20-Princetonian-21--txt-txIN-mccormick+hall-ILLUSTRATION-----\">article</a> in the \\'Prince,\\' the art museum\\'s newly expanded lower galleries housed \"collections of African, Far Eastern, Ancient and pre-Columbian art,\" with \"findings culled from Princeton University-sponsored archaeological digs in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.\"</p><p>Following the 1989 expansion, the art museum reopened in phases, with the lower floors and thus the non-Western art \"tak[ing] more time to organize,\" according to then-Director Allen Rosenbaum.</p><p>The old museum, especially its non-Western galleries, faced what Steward described in his book as \"the challenge of \\'threshold resistance,\\'\" the <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/princeton-university-art-museum-new-jersey/\">idea</a> that a visitor\\'s lack of preexisting knowledge or experience might make them feel uninvited and unwelcomed.</p><p>\"It just seemed like [non-Western art] was an afterthought,\" Zhang said.</p><p>The new museum promises to overcome this, with 95 percent of the galleries on the <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2025/10/07/venture-forward-gifts-name-multiple-spaces-within-new-princeton-university-art\">same</a> level.</p><h2>A non-hierarchical layout</h2><p>In the new art museum, 31 out of the 32 galleries are housed on the second floor, which arranges separate pavilions and interstitial galleries in a cyclical design. The only gallery on the first floor houses temporary exhibitions.</p><p>While pavilions largely separate the art geographically, the new museum\\'s layout encourages movement across the museum. Art is displayed in all the transition spaces, creating a sense of fluidity, and walls that separate galleries within pavilions do not reach all the way to the ceiling, creating a sense of openness.</p><p>In a statement to the \\'Prince,\\' Asian Art curator Zoe S. Kwok described how the Asian pavilion is \"prominently positioned\" near the Grand Stair, and \"as such, many visitors will pass the Asian art pavilion.\"</p><p>\"You are naturally drawn into non-Western areas, right off the bat,\" Breton Langendorfer, Art &amp; Archaeology Lecturer specializing in the ancient Middle East, told the \\'Prince.\\'</p><p>\"I think that the team have found incredible solutions in the beautifully fluid gallery spaces that reflect both difference and interconnectivity in space,\" Assistant Professor of Japanese Art History Rachel Saunders wrote in a statement to the \\'Prince.\\'</p><p>Still, the new art museum does not have a dedicated African art pavilion. African art is largely displayed in interstitial galleries, which a visitor encounters on the way to the Temporary Exhibitions pavilion on the second floor, currently displaying \"Princeton Collects.\"</p><p>Newth said that the floor space dedicated to African art galleries <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/10/princeton-news-adpol-art-museum-opening-explained\">increased</a> by around 700 percent from the previous building. The curation was overseen by Perrin Lathrop GS \\'21, who <a href=\"https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/news/perrin-lathrop-21-aa-assistant-curator-african-art\">joined</a> the art museum as its first permanent African art curator in 2022.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-opinion-opguest-art-museum-layout-hierarchy-levels-fairness-architecture-design\">some</a> have argued that the museum relegates African art to hallways, the art museum maintains that all gallery spaces are functionally similar, whether they are contained within a pavilion or not.</p><p>\"We see no fundamental distinction between the character of our galleries and don\\'t see any spaces in the building as \\'hallways,\\'\" Museum Spokesperson Morgan Gengo wrote in a statement to the \\'Prince.\\'</p><p>Others agree. \"It felt to me like works by African artists are not just integrated, but really integral to the organization of the museum,\" Associate Professor of African American and Black Diasporic Art Anna Arabindan-Kesson added, but noted that she had only briefly visited the museum since its opening.</p><p>Arabindan-Kesson suggested \"maybe some of those interstitial spaces are also ways to start to build those cross-historical and also aesthetic connections.\"</p><p>Zhang, however, argued that the lack of an African art pavilion suggests that the art \"is not receiving the same priority from the art museum as some of the other fields\" while acknowledging there is not \"necessarily a need to silo it in one pavilion.\"</p><h2>Juxtapositions</h2><p>The new museum has positioned artworks to juxtapose their geographical, cultural, and temporal backgrounds.</p><p>The European art pavilion, for example, contains a sculpture of \"Saint Peter Martyr\" (late 16th-early 17th century) from Mexico, which was originally thought to be Spanish and accordingly placed in the European collection, but recent research determined it was actually Mexican.</p><p>\"It shows the transitory nature of artists,\" Newth said.</p><p>The Orientation Gallery draws attention to the colonial legacy of historical figures like George Washington and former Princeton President Samuel Finley who were slaveowners, as well as the centrality of colonialism to the acquisition of pieces like a \"Nkisi\" from the early 20th century.</p><p>Charles Wilson Peale\\'s replica portrait of Washington (1787) is placed next to Titus Kaphar\\'s \"To Be Sold\" (2018), depicting Finley with sale bills nailed onto his body to represent his ownership of enslaved people. Adjacent is the \"Nkisi,\" attributed to an unrecorded artist from what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p>\"The Orientation Gallery at the outset is really successful in putting forward these difficult questions that museums are grappling with right now - questions of provenance, questions of histories of colonialism, and a certain kind of Western chauvinism,\" Langendorfer said.</p><p>Arabindan-Kesson points to the American art pavilion as another example of this. On display in the pavilion are casta paintings, originally from colonial Mexico, which are \"in conversation with works that would have come from the US,\" Arabindan-Kesson explained.</p><p>\"Thinking about how these histories of colonial conquest and genocide and histories of race also become part of the aesthetic values that we understand to be art or art history is important,\" Arabindan-Kesson added. \"So I think those are really significant interventions.\"</p><p>Although the art museum makes these overt contrasts in time and place, art within pavilions is, for the most part, geographically self-contained. For Associate Professor of Japanese Literature Brian Steininger, this allows the museum to maintain its educational <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/about\">mission</a>.</p><p>\"They\\'ve had to strike a balance between this teaching museum objective, which tends to reinforce traditional categories,\" Steininger explained. \"But I think that there\\'s also a lot of places \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 where the museum clearly is trying to find areas to allow for those kinds of unexpected juxtapositions.\"</p><p>Using the Asian art pavilion as an example, Steininger still praised the pavilions for being able to illuminate the \"interconnecting threads that lead between cultures within East Asia and then out to South Asia.\"</p><h2>New approaches to installation</h2><p>Art museums in the West have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S0006229415000581\">faced</a> criticism for their displays of non-Western pieces originally created for different, often non-public, purposes.</p><p>\"Art from East Asia is often created for very different display contexts, contexts that are occasional, temporary, and largely private, so situating them comfortably and sensitively within the architecture of a 21st century public building in North America is also a huge challenge,\" Saunders wrote.</p><p>The new art museum attempts to address these problems of display, within certain practical limits. A <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/objects/23888\">Guanyin</a> sculpture, for example, is elevated to the height at which it would have been originally viewed.</p><p>\"We tried to display [the Guanyin] in the way that it was meant to be experienced in its original context,\" Newth said, adding that \"we can\\'t do that with everything, but there are moments when we can.\"</p><p>Steininger also gave the example of darkly lit Buddhist sculptures \"which then end up kind of looming at you out of the darkness, which is how you would encounter them in a temple.\"</p><p>\"The efforts the team have gone to in the creation of individualized and object-specific installation - some of it quite daring in the parlance of conventional museum practice in the US - is remarkable, and truly centers the objects to best advantage,\" Saunders wrote.</p><h2>Grappling with provenance</h2><p>The museum has also moved in recent years to more vigorously address provenance, the often-fraught history of an object\\'s ownership beginning from its creation up until the present day.</p><p>Although the art museum actively <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/our-collections/provenance-and-collections-research\">conducts</a> provenance research, it can be difficult to determine the provenance of many pieces, especially those which were acquired decades or centuries ago. According to its <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/our-collections/provenance-and-collections-research\">website</a>, objects are frequently bought and sold anonymously, past owners may have died, dealers sometimes do not disclose their sources, and records of dealers and auction houses can be incomplete.</p><p>Consequently, works by unrecorded or unidentified artists commonly appear in the museum, particularly within non-Western art galleries.</p><p>For artists whose names are unknown, labels designate them as \"Artist unrecorded\" which \"serves as a corrective to the ways that the international circulation of their work, especially during the colonial era, erased their individuality,\" according to Lathrop, given that the work was collected without the name of the maker.</p><p>Langendorfer noted that, at least in his field of study, the ancient Middle East, \"it is historically common for specific artists or makers of objects to actually not be celebrated necessarily as individuals.\"</p><p>Moreover, on all the labels, the artwork\\'s provenance is placed directly under the artist\\'s name and the work\\'s title. For Langendorfer, highlighting provenance in this way is an effective way to \"present this material ethically. Anything less would be an abdication of the obligations of having a collection like this, or the responsibilities of having a collection like this.\"</p><p>Zhang argued that the work is not yet done. \"It\\'s work that can\\'t be done in a vacuum,\" he said. \"It really necessitates larger dialogue and partnership and transparency.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2024/09/princeon-news-adpol-university-art-museum-hires-first-provenance-curator\">Last year</a>, the art museum appointed its first-ever provenance curator, MaryKate Cleary.</p><p>In the last 20 years, Princeton has worked on repatriation efforts in addition to provenance research. This includes the return of eight looted objects to Italy in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/arts/design/27prin.html\">2007</a> as well as ten artifacts being returned to Italy in <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/09/princeton-news-broadfocus-ten-of-11-artifacts-from-university-art-museum-set-to-be-returned-to-italy\">2023</a>, six of which were loaned to PUAM by <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/04/princeton-university-art-museum-edorado-almagia\">Edoardo Almagi\\xc3\\xa0 \\'73</a>, an art dealer who was charged <a href=\"https://paw.princeton.edu/article/antiquities-dealer-edoardo-almagia-73-charged-manhattan-da\">last year</a> for allegedly looting Italian antiquities after decades of investigation.</p><p>The art museum has continuously been involved in conversations around repatriation that are \"ongoing,\" Arabindan-Kesson said. Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, for example, the museum has been \"working with Indigenous communities,\" she said.</p><p>As a general principle, according to the art museum\\'s <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/our-collections/provenance-and-collections-research\">website</a>, \"the Museum seeks to meet and surpass both the requirements imposed by law and by cultural conventions and those required or requested by the museum field.\"</p><p>In both provenance and the arrangement of its collections, the new art museum has attempted to rectify the equity issues of its predecessor, although lingering concerns remain.</p><p>\"The visitor is strongly encouraged to move from place to place, from time to time, and to make connections between objects from radically different times and places, to see all that material holistically, to see it all as part of humanistic expression,\" Langendorfer said.</p><p><i>Nikki Han is a contributing Features writer and an assistant News editor for the \\'Prince.\\'</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/08b2ac48-9718-468b-8653-33c5ac161d15.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Piano room (NEF) - Katharine Shea.jpg]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>Piano room in the art museum.</h5><h6>Katharine Shea / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/08b2ac48-9718-468b-8653-33c5ac161d15.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[New museum\\'s Asian Art Pavilion undertakes a near-impossible task to mixed success ]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Prospect]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Kate Chun]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:44:21 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-asian-art-pavilion-undertakes-a-nearly-impossible-task-to-mixed-success]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-asian-art-pavilion-undertakes-a-nearly-impossible-task-to-mixed-success]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Showcasing artworks from Chinese handscrolls to Pakistani Buddhist figurines, the Asian Art Pavilion in the newly renovated Princeton University Art Museum undertakes a near-impossible task: representing the vastness of Asia in a room only slightly larger than a lecture hall. I entered the Pavilion with the expectation that the layout of the room would be by country - and my expectations were both met and broken.</p><p>\"It\\'s an incredibly difficult thing to bring together objects from the enormous spatial, temporal, and cultural reach of what we describe in one short word as \\'Asia,\\'\" Professor of Japanese Art History Rachel Saunders wrote to The Daily Princetonian.</p><p>As I entered, I immediately noticed that East Asian cultures were integrated into varying themes, such as \\'Lacquered Objects.\\' This section featured lacquerware, a medium that originated in ancient China. With a collection spanning both time and geography, from the Chinese Eastern Zhou dynasty (771-256 BCE), the Japanese Edo period (1603-1868), and the Iranian Safavid dynasty (1501-1736), this art form highlighted the spread of Chinese influence across the continent, traced through a singular common medium.</p><p>The Pavilion\\'s South Asian and Southeast Asian pieces were isolated on the left side of the gallery, creating a feeling of division. As far as I could tell, the only representation of South and Southeast Asia comprised a small case featuring Buddhist sculptures and religious figurines from Cambodia, Pakistan, and India.</p><p>Given that there is also a collection of Buddhist sculptures housed in a hallway outside of the pavilion, I felt the section lacked a variety in subject matter. While I expected to see secular items like household objects and ceramics, as I had seen in other parts of the gallery, the display was limited to religious items.</p><p>As the back wall inside the left wing was dedicated to the Silk Road - thus featuring more Chinese art - a South Asian and Southeast Asian presence felt like an afterthought.</p><p>The pavilion\\'s curator, Zoe Kwok, is \"a Chinese specialist that is working with other colleagues to curate the entire collection, leading to people moving outside of their specialities,\" Yuchen Wang GS, a Ph.D. studentin the Art and Archaeology department, said.</p><p>While the museum is only currently showing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/arts/princeton-university-art-museum.html\">5 percent of its whole collection</a>, according to Wang, the Pavilion may begin to rotate through its pieces.</p><p>However, there were also aspects of the pavilion I enjoyed. I appreciated its overall structure, which fluidly blended scrolls, vases, and paintings, holistically embodying the vibrant history of East Asia.</p><p>Instead of the familiar cultural segmentation or chronological order that can constrain Asian history to Western stereotypes, the room\\'s venture to interweave varying pieces - old and modern; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan -placing them in conversation with one another, showcased a more nuanced perspective.</p><p>Even within the same culture, pieces interacted thoughtfully with one another. A case featuring Korean ceramics - including pieces such as a maebyeong, a Korean plum-shaped bottle from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392); an 18th-century porcelain jar; and ceramics by modern artist Young Sook Park - led me to compare the diverse styles throughout Korean history.</p><p>On the right side of the pavilion, I was greeted by a fascinating contrast of Japanese prints. The layout guides viewers through the transition from the Edo period\\'s woodblock prints of ordinary people to landscape images of bridges and gates, showcasing the impact of photography on Japanese art. Here, I could see the clash between modernity and the desire to hold onto traditional styles. I appreciated the pavilion\\'s decision to include modern photographs.</p><p>I also appreciated the pavilion\\'s juxtaposition of two large scrolls at the center of the back of the room. One was a handscroll by one of the Four Great Masters of Song calligraphy, Huang Tingjian, the other a more modern 2010 woodcut scroll by Ji Yunfei. The former was an example of \"running script,\" while the latter depicted the Three Gorges Dam migration and its effects on millions of people. The calligraphy scroll was filled with elegant characters, a traditional Chinese art form seen across various media. On the other hand, Ji\\'s scroll could be compared to a watercolor painting, with sketches of humans and natural scenes to tell a story not with words, but visceral images. I enjoyed how much the works emphasized the artist\\'s role as a storyteller, their thoughts flowing out in different directions.</p><p>\"[The Pavillon\\'s curators] reshape ways of how people understand. Instead of telling a narrative, they are trying to engage the viewers to think. The Museum is a space for viewers in dialogue,\" Wang said.</p><p><i>Kate Chun is a writer for The Prospect and part of the Class of 2029.

Since the opening of the new Princeton University Art Museum on Halloween, I explored several of its spaces to identify study spots that could potentially top my go-to cubicles at Firestone - and maybe even yours.</p><h3>Grand Hall</h3><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/b569ccc7-f42a-4d90-b1a6-2f545fc944cd.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-8c7913b8-5aec-43ad-92e2-da9346157824\" data-image=\"embedded-media-8c7913b8-5aec-43ad-92e2-da9346157824\"></figure><p>The Grand Hall, located past the art museum\\'s gift shop on the first floor, is a vast and open space. There\\'s plenty of seating, perfect for chatting with friends or taking a break from peering at exhibitions. Miniature chestnut-and-taupe couches, some back-to-back, are placed throughout the floor. The couches, along with several mustard yellow-and-orange-cushioned chairs, are paired with small, marbled coffee tables in front of them.</p><p>Above, glass walls exhibit a portion of the museum\\'s collection of ceramic trinkets, sculptures, and porcelain items on shelves. Natural lighting emanating from the gridded skylight ceiling illuminates the room in the daytime. At the front, a large projector display mostly remains black and dormant, but occasionally portrays graphics.</p><p>While the environment is certainly relaxing, I would not consider Grand Hall an all-rounder study spot. Although the room is relatively spacious and offers comfortable seating options, you might be out of luck if you need a surface. The couches, while a good spot to write essays, are definitely not the space for you if you need a hard surface to physically write on. Not only are the coffee tables small, they are quite low - so you might risk a trip to Frist Health Center for back pain before finishing your p-set. The Grand Hall works if you prefer a semi-busy atmosphere and do not need a table to work on.</p><h3>Outdoor Pavilion</h3><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/937149dd-85f6-48ea-8867-889beed4623f.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-1509b604-cd94-46a1-b590-a3f33820b6cc\" data-image=\"embedded-media-1509b604-cd94-46a1-b590-a3f33820b6cc\"></figure><p>In my search for a better study space, I headed outside, where I was greeted with a series of green metal tables and chairs below the museum\\'s northwest cantilever. Along the edge, patio umbrellas shield the tables from harsh sunlight, adding a nice touch to the area\\'s overall appearance. While the chairs were slightly wobbly and are not the most comfortable to sit in - especially compared to the lush and full seating inside Grand Hall - the circular tables provided ample surface area to work on.</p><p>With a gorgeous autumn view of fall leaves and cycling students, studying felt relaxing and unrestrictive and provided a great change of scenery from the usual blank walls of Firestone\\'s basement. I also appreciated the ability to glance ahead and see the hustle and bustle of each passerby which made the space feel more lively and motivating.</p><p>While the pavilion area is an amazing choice for folks who desire fresh air while studying, it is worth noting that the outdoors may become a less practical option as we quickly approach winter with earlier sunsets. To this point, as I studied, the wind grew progressively more frigid, and the sunset at 5 p.m. cut my session short. For this reason, to maximize your study experience outside the art museum, take advantage of the warmer and sunnier daylight hours. Once spring rolls around, though, I can imagine the pavilion area being a reliable, productive location for me as well as many others. </p><h3>Mosaic Restaurant</h3><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/67054e2c-0a10-4483-b64b-660f9cdb3270.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-0f992582-d0c1-4085-953e-b2c313af3b9d\" data-image=\"embedded-media-0f992582-d0c1-4085-953e-b2c313af3b9d\"></figure><p>As soon as I walked into the restaurant, located on the third floor of the museum, I was greeted by soft, natural lighting that permeated the room through translucent ivory curtains. The golden hour sun enveloped the room in rays of sunshine, creating a cozy environment ideal for work. At the front, a multi-colored tiled mosaic, paying homage to the restaurant\\'s name, contributed to the room\\'s luxurious essence. Brown square dining tables fill the space, topped with glass vases holding foliage.</p><p>Beneath the curtains, a dining table spanning the wall stood out to me as an ideal spot to study. The large glass windows ahead offered a beautiful view of Dod Hall and other nearby buildings. If you get hungry, Mosaic\\'s comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-lifestyle-food-review-mosaic-restaurant-art-museum?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_featured\">menu</a> offers a wide range of options, from <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-food-university-art-museum-mosaic-restaurant-review?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_featured\">desserts and baked goods</a> to coffee, tea, and other beverages. While the prices of the main courses on their menu are steep, their desserts are quite reasonably priced and could serve as a convenient and affordable source of energy during long study sessions.</p><p>Although Mosaic appears to cater more to visitors than students due to some of its higher-end prices, the atmosphere is still comparable to that of any typical coffee shop, making it an optimal setting for getting work done. However, Mosaic closes at 3 p.m. on most weekdays and the weekend, and is closed completely from Tuesday to Wednesday - so be sure to keep an eye out for available times during your next study session.</p><p>In all, although the art museum provides enjoyable views and comfortable spaces, I still prefer Firestone for urgent assignments and longer study sessions. That being said, the new museum spaces offer a change in scenery that I, as well as many other students, will appreciate in the waning weeks of the fall semester.</p><p><i>Kaichen Chou, member of the Class of 2029, is a contributing writer for the Prospect and a copy staffer.

Yet the pavilion goes beyond unifying an eclectic color palette - it also offers a powerful message on cultural intersection.</p><p>One of the works I was most moved by was the renowned Alfred Stevens painting, \"The Psych\\xc3\\xa9 (My Studio).\" Its intricately painted refined art studio space, with the delicate woman peeking from behind the mirror to meet my eye in the reflection drawing me over for a closer look, strikingly contrasts a painting by the lesser known Berta Wetman\\'s \"Interior.\" Wetman\\'s painting mirrors the subject matter and perspective of Stevens\\' work, but with a grittier, simpler beauty absent of a female muse.</p><p>The curatorial choice of creating conversations between known and less-known artists complemented one another, encouraging me to learn more about every piece. The pairings brought pieces unfamiliar to me to the forefront, expanding the context and meaning of the piece alone into one that encompasses the works on the walls surrounding it and the pavilion itself.</p><p>Even the corridor that flanks the pavilion\\'s entrance highlights pieces of seemingly non-European origin. Three central objects dominate the corridor: the Incan Cup of Montezuma brought to Spain in the 17th century, an Indian ewer made for the British Empire, and a West African ivory spoon brought to Portugal. According to Associate Curator Alexandra Letvin, the pieces are \"not European, but that circulated in Europe.\"</p><p>While this may appear strange, Letvin says this choice was intentional: \"objects that circulated in Europe had a European provenance unintentionally, or were intentionally made for European audiences.\" Letvin added that she aimed to \"show Europe looking outwards, not just looking inwards.\"</p><p>\"Europe is and has long been a crossroads - a diverse continent with many cultural traditions,\" said Annemarie Ike GS \\'23, Lecturer in the Princeton Writing Program and Art History Ph.D.. Display of European art has often centered on white, traditional voices while obscuring the diverse and complex nature of populations colonized and integrated. Yet the new openness and interdisciplinary nature of the museum help convey this reality, as a metaphor for the continent itself: porous, dynamic, and in constant exchange.</p><p>In the University\\'s old art museum, European art dominated the main level, leaving little room for art of other cultures. The new museum equalizes this space, with each pavilion sharing roughly the same footprint, and an open floorplan that allows each room to flow into the other. As I walked through and inevitably got lost, this openness and exchange between cultures and histories certainly came through in proximity between diverse pieces alone.</p><p>\"The collection is laid out more or less chronologically and geographically,\" Letvin explains. The Art Museum has long been a teaching center for professors and students in the Art History department, and Letvin has intentionally maintained this teachability by keeping content in thematic groupings in addition to chronological organization.</p><p>To achieve this fluidity, Letvin outlined three driving points, beginning with, \"Europe\\'s place within a global world,\" she explained. Works from India, Africa, and more find a home directly in the pavilion, creating a new and complex vision of Europe and its relationship with other countries.</p><p>\"I like to push back on the term masterpiece. And so one thing that we started using when we were thinking about these galleries, but really the whole museum was the idea of anchor objects,\" Letvin said. Anchor objects are used to engage other works to generate new interpretations of the work. Examples range from G\\xc3\\xa9r\\xc3\\xb4me\\'s \"Napoleon in Egypt\" and Monet\\'s \"Water Lilies\" to works by unknown artists.</p><p>The well-known works are recognizable but don\\'t dominate - they contextualize and inform the works that may be more obscure. This representation of lesser-known works and works across cultures even lends itself to the more famous pieces like Manet\\'s Woman with a Cigarette, which, as Iker noted, \"because of the uncertainties about the identity of its subject, seems to be at home in a new way in the new [pavilion].\"</p><p>Exploring the pavilion\\'s four galleries, the works seemed to flow into one another, a woven tapestry of intersecting media, cultures, and time periods. The contrast between these artistic factors and origins kept me curious about every piece and its place in the world, and that curiosity could have kept me walking around for hours.</p><p>This ambitious philosophy of centering non-European art is realized through Letvin\\'s choice to host a case of works in the central corridor of the pavilion as opposed to a single \"important painting.\" The case of works highlights the \"circulation of commodities throughout Europe and so, in a sense, becomes a more personal reflection of the stories that these three objects are telling.\" This recenters high art on a personal level, a theme that aids the sense of an interconnected global community on an intimate scale while simultaneously rewriting what defines \\'European art.\\'</p><p>Many visitors come to museums seeking the most famous pieces, but in doing so, they miss the chance to truly learn from what they are experiencing. In choosing pieces that are less well known or unconventionally European, visitors can expand their idea of what art is worthy of witnessing.</p><p>Through this focus on exchange in geography, layout, and media, Letvin leaves visitors with a clear message: \"I hope that they leave the pavilion thinking that Europe is more connected to the world around it, and I also hope that they will see that Europe\\'s boundaries shift over time ... I hope that people understand [the Art Museum] as a place within a connected world.\"</p><p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><i>Devon Williams is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2028.

Is it just a picture pasted on a wall, or is it something you can hold and move with? Maybe, according to Peter Bunnell, it\\'s all of the above.</p><p>This is the question the Princeton University Art Museum (PUAM) wrestles with in its first photography exhibit. The idea comes from Bunnell, a legend in the history of photography and the first endowed professor of photography history in the U.S. His quote, \"What Photographs Look Like,\" is the core theme of the gallery. The <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/what-photographs-look\">description</a> on the wall reads, \"Bunnell used the phrase to upend his students\\' expectations of photographs as strictly two dimensional prints and to invite delight in the expansive nature of the medium.\" I took a walk through the gallery to determine if it effectively conveys this theme of transcendence through medium and surprise.</p><p>The pavilion has only one way in: a confrontation with Narcissus. The colossal piece that characterizes the gallery, Vik Muniz\\'s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/objects/51109&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1762396192668547&amp;usg=AOvVaw0oijisXXhVhT3mPBzstwvM\" target=\"_blank\">Narcissus</a> from his series \"Pictures of Junk,\" towers over its onlookers. Due to its size, it completely blocks the viewers from seeing the rest of the gallery; one must travel around Narcissus in order to see the rest. Playing with perspective and distance, Narcissus delights from afar with its reproduction of the 16th century painting by Caravaggio.</p><p>Its magnificence reveals itself by looking closer and seeing that it is entirely composed of pieces of trash, arranged by Muniz\\'s assistants. Not just a photograph, but a living piece of artwork and sculpture, Narcissus encapsulates the idea of surpassing the medium of photography and entering other worlds. This makes it an apt choice to begin the viewer\\'s experience of this gallery.</p><p>\"I think it\\'s fantastic. I think it manages to pack an encyclopedic history of photography into an intimate space,\" saidMonica Bravo, an assistant professor of art and archaeology who specializes in the history of photography and modern art in the Americas.</p><p>Bunnell\\'s legacy is celebrated with a display of his personal collection of \"What Photographs Look Like,\" which includes objects like magazines, postcards, and even an albumen print of Nassau Hall. Bravo told the \\'Prince\\' this collection of Bunnell\\'s provides \"a range of different photographic processes as well as formats, and any idea of photography in an expanded field too.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/c6585897-f922-4503-ae82-eee22395e71b.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-57deba96-09b0-4511-911f-ded4f58e62b8\" data-image=\"embedded-media-57deba96-09b0-4511-911f-ded4f58e62b8\"></figure><p>This collection surpasses the two dimensions that often constrict photography, and there are plenty of videos featured next to images around the gallery. Bravo expressed how she thought the two could be mixed, saying, \"I actually always believe that photography should be taught in relation to other media because photography exists in a larger visual ecosystem. So for me, it was very effective to see photography placed next to video.\"</p><p>However, one piece fits awkwardly amid the rest. Wu Tsang\\'s <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/objects/138192\" target=\"_blank\">Miss Communication and Mr:Re</a> is a two-channel film, presented by two video screens parallel to each other. Mounted on the back of a dividing wall, Tsang\\'s film is accompanied by two speakers projecting separate voicemail messages of the subjects shown on screen. They look directly at the camera, expressionless. Although video and photography work in relation to each other, this piece interacts oddly with its environment.</p><p>The two voices are muffled in the noise of the other, and the flat facial expressions provide little to no enrichment when regarding for more than a couple seconds. It lacks congruency with the rest of the gallery due to its awkward placement, facing Bunnell\\'s collections and mounted on a faux-wall. A little forgettable - and more experimental than the rest - Miss Communication and Mr:Re transcends the realm of photography solely by being a film, not as an interesting merge of the two art forms.</p><p>Besides that piece, the gallery comes together cohesively. The multitudes of black and white filling the walls mask subversive elements of the artwork. One may wonder why a drawing finds itself in the photography gallery, but Sir John Herschel\\'s <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/collections/objects/40504\">\"Castle of Chillon\"</a> camera lucida drawing evokes the beginnings of the art form. The camera lucida was an optical device invented to superimpose an image of a certain object on a canvas, allowing for smooth tracing.</p><p>Paired with the history of photography, Bunnell\\'s legacy is at the forefront of this first exhibition. Bunnell died in September 2021, just mere months after the old art museum was demolished. People familiar with the history of photography will likely be familiar with his impact, and the importance of his centrality in the exhibit. However, if this is someone\\'s first entrance into photography, they may not understand the emphasis.</p><p>That does not mean they will not learn from him, as Bunnell was, above all, a teacher. His teaching persists in PUAM\\'s photography gallery, as the photographs, photo sculptures, camera lucidas, and more show \"what photographs look like.\"</p><p><i>Michael Grasso is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2029.

A Mayan chocolate-drinking cup inscribed in codex style, the vase presents a story depicting human sacrifice, calling upon the viewer to continually rotate around the vase and reveal the story told through rich iconography.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/eef05dcd-022c-4786-9a12-fb7d179733fe.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-a4f60876-5399-4ced-bb21-47009bb8cf25\" data-image=\"embedded-media-a4f60876-5399-4ced-bb21-47009bb8cf25\"></figure><p>The pavilion also features several other Mayan drinking cups, called uk\\'ibs, with inscribed images and a story told by rotating the vase. Some other Mayan drinking cups tell more pivotal stories for Mayan history. One uk\\'ib depicts the story of the infamous defeat of major underworld Gods, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, and another tells the story of the annual cycle of rebirth of the maize god, Hun Hunahpu. The displayed uk\\'ibs date back to the second half of the first millennium.</p><p>Outside of ceramic vases and plates, ceramic figures are on display throughout the pavilion. The Jaina figurines were particularly eye-catching, displayed in a line directly at eye level with their earth tones contrasting with the navy blue wall behind them.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/21c16084-6c7f-4a01-9cba-d534d05a41c4.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-a82b2388-ccce-407b-b6a5-b196cad521fe\" data-image=\"embedded-media-a82b2388-ccce-407b-b6a5-b196cad521fe\"></figure><p>The Jaina figurines were from 600-900 A.D. and associated with the islands of Jaina and Uaymil off the west coast of Mexico. Each of the figures represented different noble Mayans with various court positions and genders. The didactic explains that these figurines were often unearthed by looters and presumably associated with burials.</p><p>Museum visitors Kruti Ramani and Sabrina Yanetta described the collection as \"very expansive.\"</p><p>\"There\\'s so much to see, to look at. You see it once, and then you walk around the second time you see stuff you didn\\'t see the first time,\" Yanetta said, describing the circles she walked in the relatively small gallery.</p><p>Representing over 5,000 years of art crafted by indigenous Americans from Alaska to Chile, the collection varied across many empires across the North and South American continents.</p><p>Another compelling aspect of the Ancient Americas pavilion was the small study cases, something not available in most other pavilions in the museum. Featuring objects smaller than an inch long, the study tables provide a space in the center of the museum to examine individual objects.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/dc3bab49-c0b6-4ba1-8469-2d4b951652d5.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-68956c0d-1e61-473f-ad64-2d099729ca1f\" data-image=\"embedded-media-68956c0d-1e61-473f-ad64-2d099729ca1f\"></figure><p>Artifacts include a series of metal figures and ornaments from Qhapaq Hucha, an important sacrificial site for subjects of the Inca Empire. Metal headdress ornaments and chest plates from Peru during the first millennium are also available for close study.</p><p>The Art of the Ancient Americans pavilion is not ancient in any way. The pavilion is modern and thoughtfully juxtaposes the centuries-old artwork with a sleek design, breathing in new life and appreciation to previously forgotten art.</p><p><i>Cynthia Torres is an associate News editor and archives contributor.

You then pass a mixing bowl from the 4th century B.C.E. in southern Italy, featuring rich shades of black, orange, and white, which create stark contrasts and dazzling designs. Across from this, you see another vessel with art of a similar style; yet, rather than depicting a Greek god or a Roman emperor, it depicts modern city streets, telephone poles, and graffiti. This is the work of <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-prospect-roberto-lugo-art-museum-bainbridge\">Roberto Lugo</a>, a modern ceramicist who takes inspiration from ancient Greek art for his modern day works.</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/b78cf727-97da-462c-b02c-0a02abd2a119.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-78262350-e83b-46d5-a078-702d410ca825\" data-image=\"embedded-media-78262350-e83b-46d5-a078-702d410ca825\"></figure><p>In an interview with The Daily Princetonian, Associate Curator of Ancient Mediterranean Art Carolyn Laferri\\xc3\\xa8re calls this contrast another one of the \"surprising juxtapositions\" the pavilion presents to museum visitors. Through this decision, she hopes to inspire \"curiosity,\" inviting people to ask \"questions or \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 rethink assumptions.\"</p><p>Laferri\\xc3\\xa8re also says that, in the Ancient Mediterranean, art was used to tell stories. In Lugo\\'s vase, one continues to see how \"art is a really powerful vehicle for telling the stories of your community and of people who did extraordinary things.\" Visitors are asked not to simply glance at a wall of ceramics but rather delve into the details of each piece, to ask how the works were made in the ancient world and how they are made today.</p><p>Echoing this point, art and archeology professor John Sigmier says these surprising juxtapositions \"make the past seem not so alien.\" While the objects in the pavilion may appear \"strange\" at first, their pairing with a contemporary piece of a similar visual idiom allows visitors to view depictions of life in the ancient world as they would those of life in the 21st century.</p><p>The pavilion puts pieces that span great gaps in time and space in conversation with one another, seeking to accomplish the museum\\'s goal of promoting \"dialogue among diverse audiences, foster[ing] inquiry and curiosity, and afford[ing] encounters that excite the imagination,\" as stated in its <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/about\">mission statement</a>. Sigmier said that the space achieves this goal and that he plans to bring the students in his courses to the pavilion and say to them, \"Here\\'s what we\\'re talking about.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/7f615f41-520a-48ab-b359-6ea663ae1d13.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-77e01b2a-4932-4e0e-89e6-9936a2e37b60\" data-image=\"embedded-media-77e01b2a-4932-4e0e-89e6-9936a2e37b60\"></figure><p>The pavilion situates itself within a larger global community. Laferri\\xc3\\xa8re <a href=\"https://artmuseum.princeton.edu/art/curatorial-areas/ancient-mediterranean-art\">chose</a> pieces from the ancient civilizations of \"Near East, Egypt, Greece, Italy, and the Roman and Byzantine Empires,\" to reveal that objects, people, and ideas moved across the Ancient Mediterranean; each piece is placed in conversation with one another. A visitor walking past various sculptures of Aphrodite from different time periods and places experiences the similarities between the pieces and the inspirations the ancient peoples took from one another.</p><p>One fascinating element of the pavilion is that these pieces not only tell ancient stories but also give insight into modern geopolitical relationships. For example, former art and archeology professor Ernest DeWald Class of 1916 GS discovered that a marble head of a goat on display in the old art museum had been stolen from the Capitoline Museums in Rome during World War II. After learning this, the museum returned the piece to its rightful owners <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2012/01/25/princeton-university-art-museum-italy-reach-new-antiquities-agreement#:~:text=The%20museum%20has%20a%20history,of%20archaeological%20study%20and%20research.\">in 1953</a>. According to Laf\\xc3\\xa8rriere, Italy was so grateful for the gesture and, knowing it to be a favorite of the students, returned it to Princeton. Beside the piece is a photo of the ceremony in which it was bestowed upon the University.</p><p>These works thus span great gaps both in time and space. The visitor, in perusing the pieces, travels these distances with single steps, one moment examining a vase from fourth century B.C.E. Greece and another a fragmented statue from second century C.E. Rome. In organizing the pieces, Laferri\\xc3\\xa8re aimed to highlight the \"range of lived experience that was available in the ancient world.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/e5e52197-f3fb-42ff-9c93-7e055340882e.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" id=\"embedded-media-02d6335c-ccd8-46ff-b2dd-b2a5edf7b723\" data-image=\"embedded-media-02d6335c-ccd8-46ff-b2dd-b2a5edf7b723\"></figure><p>Each of the works holds a story. Whether in \"surprising juxtapositions\" or clear pairings, the artwork whispers tales of war, love, ritual, and everyday life to its visitors.</p><p>The pavilion presents these works in all their uniqueness and splendor, telling a story not just of the diversity of these civilizations and the connections to modernity but of a world in which we are all connected, where we are inspired by one another to bring forth newness and originality.</p><p>Laferri\\xc3\\xa8re wants visitors to leave with a sense of \"curiosity\" and \"to think through some of the questions that the ancient objects are asking of themselves,\" for many of them we continue to ponder today.</p><p><i>Zane Mills VanWicklen is a contributing writer for The Prospect and a member of the Class of 2029.

In this piece, and many of his others, Basquiat does not erase his work, instead letting the viewer in on his creative process. He crosses out words or letters just to later rewrite them, blurring the lines between draft and final product.</p><p>The pavilion\\'s walls do not reach the ceiling, lending an openness to the walk and encouraging viewers to look out across the gallery, where they will be greeted by a lively horizon at nearly any angle. In many places, it is possible to look through doorways to see large slices of the gallery, hosting a collection of radically different and curious pieces that draw you further in.</p><p>The collection boasts another Basquiat, a Yayoi Kusama painting, and multiple Willem de Kooning works. Further into the exhibit, different textures permeate the walls in a simple yet striking way. A frameless canvas with crumpled paper, glitter, sequins, and strings covered in acrylic paint - an untitled piece by Howardena Doreen Pindell (1977) - provides a range of textures in a contemporary medium.</p><p>Pindell was ahead of her time - much of her art is similar to contemporary works. She used a hole punch to draw the viewer\\'s eye to specific points of light and color, according to the piece\\'s didactic. More typical works from the 1970s might include Andy Warhol\\'s bold striking prints and colors, but Pindell subverts this preconception with its simplistic and \"undone\" characteristics.</p><p>Foradas\\'s predecessor, Kelly Baum, started the curation for the pavilion, prioritizing the way pieces interact when choosing artworks and positions.</p><p>\"My predecessor and colleagues chose and juxtaposed objects in ways that encourage the viewer to consider the impact of cultural contact and exchange,\" Foradas wrote to The Daily Princetonian.</p><p>Whether steeped in meaning or entirely meaningless, the art in the pavilion has been organized to foster curiosity and inspire.</p><p>The gallery juxtaposes Sanford Bigger\\'s \"Tunic\" (2003), a feathered puffer coat, with Elias Sime\\'s \"TIGHTROPE: ECHO?!\" a rectangular sculpture made of reclaimed electrical wire and components. The aesthetic contrast of these two pieces in such proximity reminds the viewer of how conventional artistic boundaries are broken by contemporary artists. The sharpness of \"TIGHTROPE: ECHO?!\" stands out against the colored feathers of Bigger\\'s work.</p><p>Perhaps the most charming part of the pavilion is the Hans &amp; Donna Sternberg Viewing Room attached in the northeastern-most corner of the art museum. There, the viewer leaves the layered views of textured contemporary art and finds a single work: Jane Irish\\'s \"Cosmos Beyond Atrocity\" (2024), embedded in the ceiling.</p><p>The captivating piece was commissioned for this specific room of the art museum, making for a cohesive viewing experience. While a mesmerizing distortion of angles and pastel colors warp the viewer\\'s perspective, an arm emerges from the sky and reaches towards them.</p><p>\"The Museum was keen to work with a regionally based artist committed to the continuing vitality of painting; we were thrilled that Jane was so keen to mine the collections for inspiration and to draw on the past,\" Museum Director James Steward said in a statement.</p><p>The new viewing room was adapted in modern style from a similar room in the old art museum.</p><p>\"The other viewing room felt a little bit more like a living space with a restful feeling,\" said Princeton resident Matthew Feuer. \"[The new viewing room] is more integrated into the museum.\"</p><p>However, Feuer noted that there were clear resemblances between the two: both featured identical circular windows and were surrounded by trees, including the dawn redwood <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/03/princeton-university-art-museum-exterior-is-almost-complete\">marking</a> the eastern-most point the new museum reaches. Feuer also noted that the old room didn\\'t have any art - it was only a domestic escape from the rest of the museum.</p><p>\"[The old room] was charming, but it was nothing like this,\" Feuer said.</p><p>The new Sternberg Viewing Room coaxes the viewer into meditation, providing a haven of natural and artistic surroundings.</p><p>The pavilion as a whole will be ever-changing, as the museum will periodically update the modern art displayed. Foradas has spoken with students and professors alike to gauge what the Princeton community looks for in contemporary art.</p><p>\"A few key themes emerge: landscapes and borders, activism and liberation, ways of (hi)storytelling, questioning abstraction, and the relationship between art and performance and other types of liveness,\" according to Foradas.</p><p>In the meantime, there is much art in which to indulge. This pavilion is sure to have something grab your attention, either with an eye-opening piece or a striking view across many.</p><p><i>Lulu Mangriotis is a News contributor for the \\'Prince.\\' She is from New York City.</i></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections[at]dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/f8b139fe-ce2e-437f-b139-cb703ea3be2d.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/jpg\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[PUAM_11_2_CalvinKGrover_export-27.jpg]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>\"Blubber\" by Ellen Gallagher in the Modern Art pavilion.</h5><h6>Calvin Kenjiro Grover / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/f8b139fe-ce2e-437f-b139-cb703ea3be2d.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[Calvin Kenjiro Grover]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Yiyun Li writes from the abyss in \\'Things in Nature Merely Grow\\']]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[review]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Prospect]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[life-culture]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[culture]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Christopher Bao]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:54:50 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-culture-book-review-yiyun-li-writes-abyss-things-in-nature-merely-grow]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-prospect-culture-book-review-yiyun-li-writes-abyss-things-in-nature-merely-grow]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Yiyun Li\\'s latest memoir, \"Things in Nature Merely Grow,\" begins with a careful analysis of a sentence often used to deliver news of death: \"There is no good way to say this.\" Li writes that these words, which police have delivered to her on two separate occasions, once after each of her sons died by suicide, border on clich\\xc3\\xa9. Yet they are precise. Li\\'s characteristic insistence on describing reality with precision, no matter how painful, is evident from the first chapter. She even rails against oft-used words like grief and mourning, which she believes imply an end to the pain of loss. For her, the pain will never end. This new work is not catharsis, but a reminder that life will never be all right again.</p><p>Li, the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Humanities, wrote the memoir in the year after her younger son, James, died by suicide as a first-year at Princeton, and is publishing it eight years after her older son, Vincent, died by suicide as a sophomore at Princeton High School. The book has been well-received by critics and is a finalist for the nonfiction category in this year\\'s National Book Awards.</p><p>Even before I read it, the book held a special interest for me: I was James\\'s classmate in high school, where we were both on the fencing team. I wasn\\'t a close friend but knew many who were. When I interviewed many of them last year for James\\' <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2024/02/princeton-news-obituary-james-li-first-year-student\">obituary</a> in our pages, they all talked about his kindness and reliability and humor, but they also talked abouthow quiet and enigmatic he was. The portrait of James we created always felt incomplete, so part of me wondered if reading this book could help me understand a person so mysterious in life.</p><p>Yet Li, too, often found James enigmatic in life. She writes about how Vincent, her older son, was flamboyant and captured people\\'s attention; James, on the other hand, turned away from notice. Much of James is explained in relation to his older brother, as if he remains too elusive to be defined independently. \"Vincent lived feelingly, James lived thinkingly,\" she writes. Li dreaded Vincent\\'s suicide long before it happened, but James\\' choice stunned her. Earlier parts of the book are dominated by descriptions of Vincent, which initially surprised me - but an attempt to understand James is impossible without understanding others around him, she writes. This is particularly true of his brother, who may have been the only person to truly understand James, despite their differences.</p><p>In death, James remains enigmatic -Li acknowledges throughout the book that writing in a way that is true to who James was is no easy task, and both her answers and her questions may miss the truth.</p><p>Li explains early on that she tried to orient this book not around feelings, but logic, reflecting James\\'s personality. In this, she succeeds - the close analysis gives rise to a philosophy of life fractured by deaths, a topography of loss. Li writes from an \"abyss,\" or what a friend of hers describes as a \"space outside place.\" This abyss, this place she is unable to remove herself from, is a radical acceptance - no denials, few what-ifs -of the fact that her life will never again be all right. Death is like a point in a timeline, while the sorrow in life after death has no endpoint.</p><p>It\\'s ideas like these that make the book different from many other works on loss, and it\\'s also what may make the book difficult to process for readers who believe there is no logic after loss. But for readers who can suspend judgement and allow themselves to be swept away by Li\\'s writing, this book is well-worth the read.</p><p>The structure of the work, however, is where Li\\'s ability as a writer shines. Her sentences can travel a few minutes or several years in the same paragraph. Motifs and ideas are always consequential, and Li bends phrases to create surprising meanings. \"To philosophize is to learn to die,\" from Montaigne, temporarily becomes, \"to philosophize is to learn to live with deaths.\" Reality and unreality, life and death, mother and son, are pairs described as two hands placed close to each other, with fingers just touching or intertwined.</p><p>Parents can hold their children\\'s hands through some of life, but Li recognizes that parents cannot protect their children from everything. Even though she is a better mother than her mother, and her husband a better father than his own, both of her children chose - and she is particular about this word - to exit the world. \"Both my children chose a hard thing. We are left with the hardest: to live after their deaths.\" What is to be done in the face of helplessness? How do parents live after their children die? There are some answers: for instance, Li recounts how she chose to \"do things that work,\" an idea she remembered from psychologist Marsha Linehan. Yet most of the answers are hard to find, and the questions harder to ask.</p><p>Despite the serious and sad questions the book tackles, the slim volume -just 172 pages -is largely absent of melodrama. Li\\'s prose in this memoir, as in her fiction, is precise and sharp. Adjectives and adverbs are used sparingly. Short sentences are stark and painful. \"Thinking about my children is like air, like time. Thinking about them will only end when I reach the end of my life.\"</p><p>But there are some moments that brought up strong emotions in me; I felt disbelief at the callousness of strangers and ex-friends. Li details how one writer used the news of James\\'s death as an opportunity to introduce himself and ask for referrals to a publisher. In these moments, Li\\'s writing can border on darkly funny. (She directly addresses a parent who tries to impress her with the gesture of his daughter\\'s violin-playing: \"I am a bereaved mother who happens to teach at an Ivy League university; I don\\'t work for the admissions office.\")</p><p>This work lingers less on the \"why\" of the deaths of her two children, although in a few instances, Li writes about the what-ifs, the what-could-have-beens. Each time, however, she catches herself and edits - or, to use a word she prefers, pressures - her thoughts to display rigor and respect for language and narrative. Alternatives, she writes, are fiction.</p><p>Other than a correction of her own thoughts, it seems that she is also admonishing members of the public who read more into her son\\'s deaths than anyone can understand - she dedicates several pages to American and Chinese newspapers and tabloids who were all too happy to revel in her tragedy.</p><p>Nowhere is this caution against interpretation clearer than in the title, which comes from a phrase Li thinks of when she gardens, a hobby she began a few years ago. Things in nature have no \"metaphorical or symbolic meaning beyond nature\\'s mere way of being.\" Things in nature live, and they die. And those of us who lose will continue living, until we die as well.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><i>Christopher Bao is a </i><i>senior News</i><i>writer for the \\'Prince.\\' He is from Princeton, N.J. and typically covers town politics and life.</i></span></p><p><i>Please send any corrections to corrections@dailyprincetonian.com.</i></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/91569ecf-8d96-4a13-bfed-bd068800b9fb.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/heic\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[things_in_nature_merely_grow.heic]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<h5>Things in Nature Merely Grow.</h5><h6>Christopher Bao / The Daily Princetonian</h6>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/pri/91569ecf-8d96-4a13-bfed-bd068800b9fb.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                            <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Linguistics students and faculty react to new program independence]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[Top Stories]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[news]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[top-story]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[academics]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[homepage]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[Isaac Bernstein]]></author>\\n            <author><![CDATA[Haeon Lee]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:54:00 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-linguistics-launches-independent-program-in-linguistics-react]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-linguistics-launches-independent-program-in-linguistics-react]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>At a Nov. 3 faculty meeting, faculty voted unanimously to <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-faculty-meeting-linguistics-academic-unit\">declare</a> the Program in Linguistics an independent academic unit. The change <a href=\"https://dof.princeton.edu/rules-and-procedures-faculty-princeton-university-and-other-provisions-concern-faculty/chapter-iii-0\">moves</a> the program out of the Council of the Humanities, and into the Social Sciences Academic Division.</p><p>With the move, the program gains the autonomy to hire new faculty and now has an independent financial chartstring. Although the program is not yet an official department, current Linguistics faculty and independent majors celebrated the step forward.</p><p>\"This is an extremely exciting moment for the Program in Linguistics, one we have been working towards for many years!\" wrote Associate Professor Laura Kalin in a statement to The Daily Princetonian. Kalin also serves as the associate director of the Program in Linguistics.</p><p>\"Really the only change was we would have to change the logo on our merch: we can\\'t use the humanities logo anymore,\" said Linguistics concentrator Ellie Noland \\'27.</p><p>Kalin, along with then-director Adam Elga, <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/11/princeton-news-adpol-faculty-meeting-linguistics-academic-unit\">proposed</a> this change back in Nov. 2023 in a memo to the Academic Planning Group. Kalin hopes to establish an official major in linguistics next, as those intending to major in linguistics are currently required to <a href=\"https://linguistics.princeton.edu/independent-major/\">complete</a> an independent major application.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to have the support of university leadership and the university community for our independence as an academic unit in the social sciences, a move which aligns with our current research methodologies and course offerings as well as our planned future path for growth,\" Kalin wrote.</p><p>Jordan Chi \\'28, a prospective math major who considered a linguistics major, told the \\'Prince,\\' \"It makes sense [that] they\\'re shying away from the humanities label.\"</p><p>\"Linguistics is very broad and interdisciplinary,\" he added. \"I think a lot of what linguists are doing is very computational in nature.\"</p><p>For students who have declared the independent major in Linguistics, the shift is welcome, but not significant.</p><p>\"I hadn\\'t heard anything about the change.

University researchers will be among the first to have the opportunity to use it, contingent on their engagement with the AI Hub.</p><p>There are high hopes. With Discovery, researchers will be able to \"take on problems that maybe to this point have been too complex to be entertained, to be researched, to be touched,\" Pryor wrote.</p><p>Krawczyk also said that the program will be able to analyze data that would otherwise \"take humans a very long time\" because of the scale of the datasets and the complexity of the processes required to analyze it.</p><p>This new platform was launched in private preview in May, two months after the <a href=\"https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/03/princeton-news-research-ai-hub-opening-microsoft-coreweave\">opening</a> of the NJ AI Hub, located on Route 1. Princeton University and Microsoft are two of the <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/01/31/governor-murphy-and-princeton-university-president-eisgruber-announce-microsoft-and-coreweave-as-founding-partners-in-nj-ai-hub/\">founding partners</a> of the AI Hub, joined by AI computing company Coreweave and the <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2023/12/20/governor-murphy-and-princeton-announce-plans-establish-artificial-intelligence-hub\">New Jersey Economic Development Authority</a>.</p><p>After testing Discovery in Microsoft labs throughout the summer, and already yielding breakthroughs, such as a \"novel sustainable coolant prototype for datacenter immersion cooling,\" Microsoft is leaning into the University to continue pioneering breakthroughs with the new technology, Pryor wrote.</p><p>\"It goes without saying Princeton has global prestige,\" Pryor told the \\'Prince\\' in an interview. \"When you\\'re looking for top tier research, look no further in many cases, and so [Princeton] was an easy and obvious early partner to lean in with.\"</p><p>Princeton and the NJ AI Hub will not be the only location for this new AI software. <a href=\"https://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-partners-with-microsoft-and-titletowntech-to-accelerate-ai-driven-scientific-discovery/\">TitletownTech</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was selected as the second location where Discovery will be simultaneously launched.</p><p>Pryor said that she and her counterpart at Titletown serve as the \"connective tissue\" between the two locations - a connection that is expected to surge once the program has been actively launched.</p><p>\"The rollouts will be on par with one another,\" Pryor said. \"Down the line, once it\\'s actively running, there would be shared learning, shared collaboration, perhaps even shared expertise across the two locations.\"</p><p>Both locations were chosen as fountainheads for Discovery because of \"the uniqueness of the [local] industry clusters,\" Pryor explained. For New Jersey, these are the ones situated along the <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/transportation/works/njfit/route1rsg.shtm\">Route 1 corridor</a>.</p><p>While both locations are pursuing similar goals of innovation, they differ in the type of industry they are promoting. Emphasizing that there is not a \"hard split\" between the two, Pryor explained that Microsoft is leaning towards New Jersey primarily for pharmaceutical, life sciences, and health industry-focused research, while leaning towards Wisconsin for the material sciences and manufacturing industry.</p><p>Both locations, however, are set to be crucial in \"discovering new materials, new drugs, new cures, new treatments at record pace,\" Pryor said.</p><p>The process to be chosen for Discovery access will be selective, according to Krawczyk. She explained that \"the use cases that will be selected are the ones for which the platform is most ripe to help them\" - cases that \"make sense for the platform.\"</p><p>Both Pyror and Krawczyk emphasized finding what Pyror called the \"right stakeholders\" and what Krawczyk called \"trustworthy partners.\"</p><p>\"What criteria - what does that look like? What type of elements would be a desirable, successful project? Who has to be at the table? The readiness of the entities that we\\'re engaging with?\" Pryor told the \\'Prince,\\' regarding what factors were important in considering access to Discovery - or, as she put it, making a \"match\" with the proper industry partner.</p><p>\"Assume that 100 percent of chemists have expertise in chemistry - maybe two percent of chemists are computational chemists,\" Krawczyk added. \"The question is: Can we take someone with deep expertise in their own domain and lend them computational capabilities and large data kinds of conclusions that would accelerate their research?\"</p><p>Currently, Discovery seems more oriented towards larger, group-led projects. While Pyror emphasized that a \"substantive\" enough individually-led project would be considered for Discovery access, the program will primarily be concerned with adhering to the \"collective brain trust\" in New Jersey and \"trying to bring the right groups, small groups, but the right groups of people together.\"</p><p>Krawczyk added that she hopes the program includes not just \"the Princeton community, but also other higher education communities everywhere, from students to faculty who are interested in AI\" - communities that the AI Hub is \"certainly open to partnerships\" with, \"to the extent that they make sense for [Discovery].\"</p><p>Pryor also said that Microsoft hopes both the NJ AI Hub and Titletown will become \"models that will draw other people to these locations, to be able to access this type of ecosystem for this level of scientific advancement.\"</p><p>The rollout of Discovery is expected in the coming months. There are no current plans for extension to other locations, according to Pryor.</p><p><i>Luke Grippo is an assistant News editor and senior Research writer for the \\'Prince.\\' He is from South Jersey, and typically covers University and town politics, on a national, regional, and local scale.

In her words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexhausting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before moving to Stanford, Galaise attended community college as a single mother, relying on food stamps and her school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s food pantry to support herself and her son, now 11 years old.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came to class so foggy-headed. When you don&#8217;t have those basic needs met, nothing else really matters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Galaise said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if you have food in the moment, if you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to be tomorrow, it messes with [you].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nearly one in eight Americans <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/11/14/what-the-data-says-about-food-stamps-in-the-us/#how-many-americans-use-food-stamps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">receive</a> food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Recipients, such as Galaise, faced food stamp delays during the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/12/us/politics/government-shutdown-vote-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ended</a> Wednesday night.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>California used state money to <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/11/snap-benefits-update-funding/?utm_source=The+19th&amp;utm_campaign=e43a8c6e69-19th-newsletters-daily-1113&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-be3d85c373-383080854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fund</a> its SNAP program, CalFresh, during the shutdown. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBenefits were delayed due to the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to oppose the issuance of full benefits during the shutdown,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) website <a href=\"https://www.cdss.ca.gov/benefits-services/food-nutrition-services/calfresh/calfresh-frequently-asked-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">states</a>.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mona Hicks, the senior associate vice provost and dean of students, wrote to The Daily that the Dean of Students Office (DoS) does not have aggregate data on how SNAP cuts impacted Stanford students.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoS is aware of individual students who rely on those funds. As a result, we are continuing to work in close collaboration with our campus partners, particularly FLISSC [First-Generation and/or Low-Income Student Success Center],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hicks said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now that the shutdown is over, benefits will continue as usual. For people who recently applied to CalFresh, the CDSS website states benefits may be delayed but will be provided soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Worried about her food stamps during the shutdown, Galaise said she switched out of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthriving\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and back to \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurviving,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saving money and food stamps in case of total SNAP cuts.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only reason I knew to do that is because I&#8217;ve experienced losing my food stamps, and it sparks all of those survival skills,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>About a week into November, despite warnings from SNAP about cuts, she received all of her food stamps. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was so relieved. At Stanford, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about, how can you thrive? If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still surviving, then you feel like you&#8217;re left behind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While her role as a food security advocate has helped Galaise feel more comfortable sharing her story, she said that food insecurity is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolutely stigmatized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at Stanford.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFood insecurity here looks extremely different than it does at community college, but it&#8217;s still happening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that&#8217;s important to talk about because this is the one place you think it wouldn&#8217;t be happening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When she arrived at Stanford, she felt \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch embarrassment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about food insecurity.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople just don&#8217;t want to talk about it. I was like, &#8216;I can&#8217;t go to the dean&#8217;s office and ask them for food. I&#8217;m the only one experiencing that,&#8217;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Galaise said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, Galise works as a student office assistant and basic needs intern at DoS, providing in-person administrative and office support. Since the beginning of the shutdown, DoS has heard directly from students on SNAP or CalFresh benefits who have been struggling, Hicks said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Along with developing a basic needs webpage of resources, DoS opened Thrive Market food pantry on Nov. 3. The market, which DoS is building out with shelf-stable foods, is located on the second floor of Tresidder Memorial Union. The disruption to SNAP funding prompted a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crush to get food on the shelves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so students could find resources on campus during the uncertainty of the shutdown.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other resources available to students like Galaise include Stanford Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&amp;DE), which <a href=\"https://rde.stanford.edu/food-pantry-pop-up#faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hosts</a> monthly food pantry pop-ups where eligible students can receive produce, dairy, eggs and non-perishable items at no cost. Additionally, Territorial Markets is <a href=\"https://pluricalifornia.github.io/plurinational-landreform/territorial_markets.html#contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offering</a> a SNAP Special Program to provide free groceries to those impacted by SNAP cuts.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Several off-campus clubs are also helping provide food resources. From Nov. 17-21, two Palo Alto Rotary Clubs and a Kiwanis Club are holding a food drive for the Downtown Streets Team Food Closet <a href=\"https://www.asaints.org/foodcloset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at</a> All Saints Episcopal Church Palo Alto.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Richard Schoelerman, a member of the Rotary Club, said his club has been helping the food closet for almost two years. In light of possible SNAP delays, this week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s food drive will support people who need extra food assistance at this time.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorking with the other two service clubs, we decided that all three of us could do a better job of raising more food donations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schoelerman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt just so happens that it came at this time where the government shutdown came along.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/food-insecure-students-weather-snap-disruptions-following-government-shutdown/\">Food insecure students weather SNAP disruptions following government shutdown\\xc2\\xa0</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/food-insecure-students-weather-snap-disruptions-following-government-shutdown/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1280001</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/dining-hall-specials-served-for-aweek/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/dining-hall-specials-served-for-aweek/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Lily Dominguez]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:36:26 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[chef]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Dining]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[dining halls]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[dinner]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[eating]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Food]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[lunch]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[meals]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[R&DE]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[specials]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford Dining]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279993</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The chef\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dinner special in each dining hall is now available from Monday through Friday each week and posted in advance. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/dining-hall-specials-served-for-aweek/\">Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>Residential and Dining Enterprises (R&amp;DE) has begun serving weekly chef\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dinner specials in each dining hall since Oct. 20. R&amp;DE now also announces the specials in advance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The same special is served at dinner from Monday through Friday as one part of that meal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s menu and students are able to see each dining hall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special via dining hall signage and Instagram posts on @stanforddining.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last year, dinner specials were not announced in advance and were only available while supplies lasted \\xe2\\x80\\x94 typically for just one day.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to Eric Montell, the assistant vice provost for Stanford Dining, Hospitality and Auxiliaries, in an email to The Daily, the specials \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperated like the classic chef&#8217;s special at a restaurant, a pleasant surprise you discovered when you went out to eat, with the wait staff announcing the chef&#8217;s special of the day when taking your order.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>R&amp;DE decided to pivot due to student feedback, Montell said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome students told us they&#8217;d prefer to know the chef special ahead of time so they could plan their dining around classes and other commitments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Montell wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStudents also mentioned occasionally missing out on specials they wanted to try due to the one-day availability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though many students have not yet heard about the change, several liked the stability the new initiatives provide in comparison to the unpredictable nature of non-special food items.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of times the website will be inaccurate, or sometimes there&#8217;ll be food items that they&#8217;ll talk about on the website, but then when you actually go in person to the dining hall, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s pretty different,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Siddharth Bellam &#8217;29.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Vivian Sullon Vicente &#8217;29 agreed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt should be really good to have a menu to see and realize where we want to go to eat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, some students said they didn&#8217;t have the capacity to go to specific dining halls based on dinner specials.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersonally, when things are getting busy, I don&#8217;t really plan out \\xe2\\x80\\x98I want to eat this, therefore, I&#8217;ll go to XYZ dining hall,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Faith Qin &#8217;29. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead I&#8217;m just like, what&#8217;s near me right now and what&#8217;s gonna close?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With less dining halls near their dorms, some students living on west campus felt they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have easy access to as many of the specials as east campus students. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt can become repetitive, especially for me cause I eat dinner and breakfast at the same place pretty much everyday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte Burnham &#8217;26. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the best when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the special either and get stuck with it. Sometimes consistency is nice, but I find people usually have a few dining halls they usually eat at, so it can definitely get old quick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ben Jonker &#8217;28 appreciated the change but wished the dishes themselves were more unique.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt&#8217;s nice that they are making efforts to try and alleviate some of the problems of us eating the same three meals every day for the entire quarter, so in that extent I like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think one of the problems with the way they&#8217;re doing specials right now is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of the same stuff they would normally serve but just every day for the week. I don&#8217;t think I would ever go out of my way to go to a dining hall just because of the special.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>R&amp;DE offers many ways for diners to provide feedback. Soon, students will be invited to vote on future chef specials so \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe menu further reflects what students are most excited to see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to Montell. For now, students can share their suggestions directly with the chefs in the dining halls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including at their weekly open office hours from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and complete the Dining Customer Satisfaction Survey sent directly to student emails, which will be open until Nov. 21.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are grateful for the student feedback that is helping us make the dining program an even more welcoming and exciting part of campus life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Montell wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there&#8217;s a dish students want, a cuisine they love or a dietary need we can support, please let your chef know, as we are here for students, and they are never an interruption in our day.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/dining-hall-specials-served-for-aweek/\">Dining hall dinner specials now served regularly</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/dining-hall-specials-served-for-aweek/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279993</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Torrential rains batter Stanford on path through California</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/torrential-rains-batter-stanford-on-path-through-california/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/torrential-rains-batter-stanford-on-path-through-california/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Paridhi Bhatia]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 08:13:34 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[biking in the rain]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[drought]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[raining]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[storm]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[weather]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279988</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>An atmospheric river storm moving through California hit Stanford for a second time Sunday night.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/17/torrential-rains-batter-stanford-on-path-through-california/\">Torrential rains batter Stanford on path through California</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>After a short weekend reprieve following Thursday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s downpour, Stanford will see half an inch of rain between 11 p.m. Sunday night and 2 p.m. Monday afternoon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On Thursday, Stanford, unable to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/bay-area-atmospheric-river-november-13-heavy-rain-winds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">escape</a> an atmospheric river storm that brought strong winds and heavy rain to the Bay area and the Santa Cruz mountain, received 1.37 inches of rain. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough biking to class, for sure, especially when you forget your raincoat\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you get soaked on the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Griffin Jason Lee &#8217;27.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lee, who is from Georgia, said the rain at Stanford is colder than storms he experienced at home.

The reason is obvious: universities are bastions of free thinking, deep thinking, critical thinking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and thinking, in all its forms, is what an authoritarian regime hates and fears the most. As soon as Trump took office, his administration began attacking the three elements of civil society that pose the greatest threat to authoritarian rule: the free press, which spreads knowledge of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in the halls of power; the justice system, which holds abusers of power to account and higher education, which teaches people to think.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Surprisingly, our institutions of journalism, justice and higher education haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really fought back. Instead, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquiesced, paid extortionist fines and accepted intolerable restrictions.

At Stanford, the University <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/08/02/dont-know-what-we-will-do-university-dissolves-office-for-inclusion-belonging-and-intergroup-communication/\">closed </a>our Office for Inclusion and Belonging, canceled a diversity-building doctoral fellowship (DARE) and announced there will be no student speakers at Commencement in an email to faculty.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Universities must stop acquiescing and fight back. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to talk about <strong>three things </strong>that are essential to our struggle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>I. Solidarity</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The American Association of University Professors (AAUP), <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/about/history-aaup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">founded </a>in 1915 to defend academic freedom, grew out of something that happened at Stanford in 1900. Jane Stanford, a founder of the University, and David Starr Jordan, the founding president, forced economics professor Edward Ross to resign after he <a href=\"https://ed.stanford.edu/news/academic-freedom-s-origin-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criticized </a>the railroad industry, the <a href=\"https://ed.stanford.edu/news/academic-freedom-s-origin-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">source </a>of Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wealth. George Howard, a history professor, resigned in solidarity, beginning an <a href=\"https://ed.stanford.edu/news/academic-freedom-s-origin-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exodus</a> that grew to include 10% of the Stanford faculty. One of the academics who left was philosophy professor Arthur Lovejoy, the eventual founder of the AAUP. He and the other AAUP creators recognized that academic freedom requires collective action.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The current assault on higher education takes various forms: <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/eo-accreditation-opens-door-rampant-corruption-and-political-interference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threats</a> to revoke accreditation for ideological reasons, the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/rumeysa-ozturk-best-friend-inside-story-tufts-trump-louisiana-ice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">harassment and kidnapping </a>of international students, attempts to <a href=\"https://www.acenet.edu/Policy-Advocacy/Pages/2025-Trump-Administration-Transition.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dictate </a>curricular content, <a href=\"https://www.acenet.edu/Policy-Advocacy/Pages/2025-Trump-Administration-Transition.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suppression </a>of academic programs or methodologies, draconian funding <a href=\"https://www.acenet.edu/Policy-Advocacy/Pages/2025-Trump-Administration-Transition.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cuts</a> and extortionist fines. Our fellow California university, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), is <a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2025/08/08/proposed-ucla-settlement-from-federal-government-seeks-1-billion-policy-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">facing </a>a $1.25 billion fine and demands for a federal ideology monitor. In the face of these attacks, institutional solidarity is a strategic necessity and a moral imperative.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Solidarity begins with public statements\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 university presidents, boards of trustees and faculty senates should speak out when peer institutions are attacked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough. Professional associations must coordinate legal and advocacy resources. Accrediting bodies must refuse to become tools of political coercion. Alumni networks must mobilize. Students, faculty and staff must rally, protest, write and speak out. So far, this has largely failed to materialize. The schools facing billions of dollars in fines and funding freezes have each responded independently. The universities that received the offer of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d requiring them to compromise their autonomy also responded individually. As Benjamin Franklin <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-22-02-0284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(may have) said,</a> we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>II. Integrity, not Neutrality</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstitutional neutrality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has become a pretext for institutional cowardice. The idea goes back to 1967, when, during a period of campus activism over the Vietnam War, the University of Chicago <a href=\"https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/KalvenRprt_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReport on the University&#8217;s Role in Political and Social Action. Chaired by law professor Harry Kalven Jr., the Kalven Report stated that universities should maintain \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca heavy presumption against the university taking collective action or expressing opinions on the political and social issues of the day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The report&#8217;s core principle was that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe instrument of dissent and criticism is the individual faculty member or the individual student. The university is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The point was to allow competing views to coexist within a university community.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than half a century later, in 2018, universities suddenly began officially <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/adoptions-official-position-institutional-neutrality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adopting</a> the Kalven principles. Dozens have <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/adoptions-official-position-institutional-neutrality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">followed,</a> including Stanford in 2024. This recent rush to embrace \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneutrality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reflects a self-protective impulse, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misguided. The Kalven Report notably acknowledged that universities must speak when their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery mission and its values of free inquiry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are under threat.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The current moment throws the limits of institutional neutrality into sharp relief. Every university budget is a statement of values. Each hiring decision enacts priorities. All curricular choices embody commitments. When a university claims neutrality on all political questions while investing its endowment, designing its financial aid policies or determining which academic programs to expand or eliminate, it is disingenuous. The Kalven principle has value within limits, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re light years beyond them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What we need now is institutional integrity. We must openly defend what we stand for: free inquiry, evidence-based reasoning, equal access to education, the protection of vulnerable community members. If we remain \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneutral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while our core values are attacked, we will have nothing left to defend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>III. Student speech</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Institutions have recently responded to student activism by banning student speeches at commencements. In April 2024, the University of Southern California (USC) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/26/usc-cancelled-speech-asna-tabassum-muslim-student\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">canceled </a>valedictorian Asna Tabassum&#8217;s commencement speech following criticism of social media posts in which she expressed support for Palestinian rights. In May 2025, at George Washington University, graduating senior Cecilia Culver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/george-washington-university-palestine-speech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used</a> her commencement speech to call for divestment from Israel. The university banned her from campus. That same month, NYU <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxydg11ego\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">withheld</a> graduate Logan Rozos&#8217;s diploma after he delivered an unapproved speech denouncing Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacks on Gaza. And in June 2025, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/01/us/mit-graduation-palestine-megha-vemuri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned </a>its senior class president, Megha Vemuri, from the graduation ceremony after she delivered a pro- Palestinian speech at an earlier event.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, Stanford has followed, quietly informing department chairs that there will be no student speakers at Commencement. This sends a terrible message to students: though your education has taught you to think freely, deeply and critically, we don&#8217;t trust you to speak publicly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let us act in solidarity and with integrity. Let us trust our students to speak. Let us hear them. Let us above all stand up and fight back to defend higher education. If we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, who will?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Jessica Riskin is a professor in the history department and the co-president of Stanford&#8217;s chapter of the American Association of

critiques.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Marjane (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarji\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Satrapi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a graphic novel that pairs stark black-and-white art with a voice so alive, so rebellious and so uncensored that you forget you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reading about a revolution until you feel it happening under your skin.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, in a nod to Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, derives its title from the capital of the ancient Persian Empire\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Satrapi tells the story of her childhood in Iran during the Islamic Revolution and her adolescence in Europe. She chronicles her life with\\xc2\\xa0the kind of clarity only a child \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then, a woman who has survived such things\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 can provide. Early in the book, young Satrapi announces, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was born with religion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a line that is humorous in its bluntness but heavy with reality. She proceeds to spend the rest of the memoir wrestling with the difficulty of having an identity handed to you before you know how to pronounce it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What stands out most in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is how Satrapi depicts the collision of innocence and political upheaval. One page shows\\xc2\\xa0Satrapi dreaming of being a prophet. The next portrays executions and bombings. Yet another\\xc2\\xa0illustrates her bargaining for a Michael Jackson button even though \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was strictly forbidden,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Satrapi writes. The memoir never sanitizes childhood; instead, it honors how children pick up the pieces adults break. At one point, Satrapi says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe revolution is like a bicycle. When the wheels don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn, it falls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of metaphor you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, because it comes from a girl who is trying desperately to understand why her world keeps collapsing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Satrapi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feminism is loud, impulsive, contradictory and wonderfully human. Satrapi refuses to be the quiet, obedient daughter the new regime insists she become. When her school orders all girls to wear a veil, Satrapi says: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really like to wear the veil, especially since we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why we had to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In her teenage years, when she buys Western clothes despite the risk, she tells us with pride that she feels \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even as Guardians of the Revolution scold her for her punk jacket. Satrapi shows how girlhood itself becomes an act of rebellion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that growing up with your own thoughts is threatening in a society where obedience is the preferred national sport.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is more than a story of oppression. One of the most powerful lines in the memoir comes from Satrapi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandmother, who tells her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlways keep your dignity and be true to yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a message that becomes the backbone of the book, as Satrapi shows how difficult \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and how essential \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that instruction is. Her feminism is inherited, nurtured and relentless. Even the women around her who do conform, who stay silent or wary, radiate a quiet strength. Refreshingly,\\xc2\\xa0 Satrapi treats them not as symbols but as people navigating impossible circumstances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The memoir is also sharply and unexpectedly funny in the way truth often is. Satrapi recounts how she and her classmates mocked their teachers, how she declared at age six that she wanted to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe last prophet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and how she marched around pretending to lead the revolution. Humor becomes a survival skill, a way to stay human when humanity is under threat.

Here, the memoir shifts into a different tone. Satrapi begins to understand that freedom can be disorienting and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9csometimes you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a line so striking, it is little wonder that it is often cited in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/06/review-marjane-satrapi-persepolis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a>. Adolescent Satrapi is homesick, rebellious, depressed, self-destructive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and painfully honest about all of it. That honesty is what gives \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0its feminist core: it\\xc2\\xa0refuses to give us a sanitized heroine who triumphs through purity. Satrapi gives us a girl who is flawed, angry, brilliant and real.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By the time Satrapi says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI finally understood that I was nothing but a Westerner in Iran, an Iranian in the West,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the memoir becomes not just a personal story but a universal one about the longing to belong, the impossibility of fitting neatly into categories, the work of constructing an identity from fragments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not a tragedy, though it is full of heartbreak. It is not a political manifesto, though it critiques politics better than most manifestos do. It is, instead, a story about survival, the survival of humor, of girlhood, of truth, of resistance, of self. It is a reminder that becoming yourself is political in a world determined to tell you who you should be.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the book ends and Satrapi walks through the airport, leaving her country behind, the only thing she hears is her mother fainting. Satrapi closes her memoir with a haunting phrase: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was the last time I ever saw them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And that final panel \\xe2\\x80\\x94 simple, devastating \\xe2\\x80\\x94 tells you everything you need to know about the cost of freedom. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersepolis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Satrapi makes her defiance clear through both the written word and art. And in doing so, she gives every reader \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially every woman \\xe2\\x80\\x94 permission to do the same.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/text-and-the-city-persepolis-by-marjane-satrapi-draws-girlhood-in-ink-and-defiance/\">Text and the City: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Persepolis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by Marjane Satrapi draws girlhood in ink and defiance</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/text-and-the-city-persepolis-by-marjane-satrapi-draws-girlhood-in-ink-and-defiance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279929</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Senior Scaries: Treating dating like the job market</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/senior-scaries-treating-dating-like-the-job-market/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/senior-scaries-treating-dating-like-the-job-market/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Erin Ye]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:20:50 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[The Grind]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[algorith]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[algorithm]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[boyfriend]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Date Drop]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[dates]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[dating]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[graduating]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[job market]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[love]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[marriage pact]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[match]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[post-grad dating]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[relationship]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[relationships]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Senior]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[senior scaries]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279797</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>As she prepares to enter the post-grad dating pool, Ye reflects on her mom\\'s unique relationship advice and her struggle to find the right person at Stanford. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/senior-scaries-treating-dating-like-the-job-market/\">Senior Scaries: Treating dating like the job market</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p><em>In each installment of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenior Scaries,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Erin Ye &#8217;26 confronts her senior-year fears in her final three quarters at Stanford.

Think of it like getting an <em>internship</em>. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about the return offer just yet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The metaphor was likely absurd on purpose, but underneath the shock factor, my mom had a point. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame her for being tired of me complaining about a problem I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meaningfully tried to solve.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In high school, I was far too nerdy to date, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve dated very minimally during my time at Stanford. I remember my (happily taken) freshman-year roommate telling me late one night in our room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt happens when you least expect it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem. I am <em>always</em> expecting it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to senior year, and I am still bound by the same affliction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At this point, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made every excuse in the book: too busy with school, too focused on my career, not interested in anybody, <em>yada yada yada</em>. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also had many conversations with friends that have gone along the lines of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStanford-men-are-the-problem-we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re-perfect-as-we-are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When you look at it like that, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not surprising at all that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a boyfriend. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made it pretty obvious I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want one.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And I really am happy with my life as it is. I have the best friends and family in the world, I love what I study and I have a job lined up after graduation. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no lack of love in my existence. I think, for me, this conversation is more about conquering an age-old insecurity and not letting a fear of rejection hold me back from good things in the future. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough to sit around waiting for a bomb to drop or to wonder why no one has left a love letter at your door or to do Date Drop and Marriage Pact and expect black-box algorithms to find your soulmate for you (especially when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have the guts to reach out to your match). At the very least, your internal wants and external actions need to align.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yes, it is scary to be graduating from college and entering the murky waters of the post-grad dating scene. Stanford was probabilistically the best place to find a good match, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s both awesome and horrifying to think that some of the people I know are already dating the person they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to marry. But just like how you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get hired by being envious of those who are employed, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely stay single forever if all I do is take stock of the couples around me. I wish I could have written this column about how I conquered my fears and went on 50 first dates, but that&#8217;s not happened yet. But once I develop a pick up line as good as my cover letter template, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game on.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/senior-scaries-treating-dating-like-the-job-market/\">Senior Scaries: Treating dating like the job market</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/senior-scaries-treating-dating-like-the-job-market/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279797</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Stanfordle #041 (Nov. 17, 2025)</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/stanfordle-041-nov-17-2025/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/16/stanfordle-041-nov-17-2025/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anisha Pandey]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 22:15:30 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanfordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[fun]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[game]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[nyt games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[puzzle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[puzzles]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stanford wordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stanfordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stanfordles]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[word]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[word game]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[wordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[wordles]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[words]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279918</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Enjoy Stanfordle, The Daily\\'s newest addition to our Games section.

However, now the Cardinal have to continue developing the supporting cast.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Freshman guard<strong> </strong>Ebuka Okorie<strong> </strong>continued his electric start to the season Wednesday night, pouring in 21 points \\xe2\\x80\\x94 15 after halftime \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as Stanford closed on a 22-7 run to beat Montana State (1-3, 0-0 Big Sky) 77-68 at Maples Pavilion. The win marked the Cardinal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third straight victory over a Big Sky opponent to open the season, but it again underscored how much they lean on their first-year star.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Okorie, who leads all Division I freshmen in scoring and is seventh overall in the nation at 25.3 points per game, shot 7-of-15 from the field and added three assists and multiple key defensive plays down the stretch. Head coach Kyle Smith admitted afterward that the offense runs heavily through the 6-foot-2 guard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pretty Ebuka-centric,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said following the game. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to learn how to play without him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not always going to play his best game, but at the end of the day he had a pretty good line and was one of the best players out there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stanford led by as many as 10 in the first half before Montana State clawed back, taking a six-point lead with just over eight minutes remaining. From there, Okorie helped steady the Cardinal. Okorie converted a three-point play and later drilled a late-clock three-pointer during the closing surge, while Stanford tightened up defensively, forcing the Bobcats into tough one-on-one shots.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe brought his best when it was needed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said of Okorie. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good competitor, to be able to do that as a freshman and stay locked in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The freshman did not lead the comeback effort by himself though. Senior guard Benny Gealer and senior forward Chisom Okpara provided vital balance, finishing with 16 and 15 points, respectively, while graduate forward AJ Rohosy added 13 points and a team-high seven rebounds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gealer set the tone early, scoring Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first eight points and hitting a trio of three-pointers in the first half, then knocked down another big triple late as the Cardinal pulled away.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stayed aggressive. I&#8217;m a shooter because I trust my shot and just let the game come to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gealer, who finished 4-of-6 from beyond the arc. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo if I&#8217;m open and I get my feet under me, I think it helps our team if I&#8217;m aggressive and space the floor. It was a big team win for us. There was some adversity in the middle and our team was able to get over that hump.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Okpara repeatedly punished the Bobcats inside, helping Stanford turn a cold 5-of-19 night from behind the arc into a paint-heavy attack that produced 46 points in the paint.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe main thing was just playing defense and staying in front one-on-one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Okpara said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so we just had to lock in on defense and stop the ball and just continue to play through the inside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Still, the reliance on the starting five was glaring. Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s starters scored 73 of the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 77 points, with the bench going just 1-of-15 from the field and contributing four points. Smith pointed to illness and rhythm issues for some regular reserves, but he did not sugarcoat the production gap.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur bench did not produce,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, we were 1-for-15 off the bench. That&#8217;s not good. It&#8217;s just not good enough. [Ryan Agarwal] had been sick, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an important part of our deal. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not 100% right now and needs to get back in the flow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One bright spot off the bench was freshman forward Oskar Giltay, who played only five minutes but delivered two blocks and two rebounds, sparking Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defensive intensity in the second half. Smith called the decision to insert Giltay, who had not practiced much this past week, a bit of a gamble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You know what, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just put him in this situation,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and he was huge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo blocked shots, an offensive rebound and a defensive rebound. He really flipped the game for us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Okpara was also quick to praise the contribution of Giltay.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a freshman to stay ready like that, who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play last game and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play the first half, and then come in right away with great blocks and defensive presence, he gave us great energy and a big boost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even at 3-0, it is clear that this team is still learning how to play together, and how to win when Okorie is not carrying the load.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good to be 3-0, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the next-practice mentality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gealer said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got four or five practices before the next game, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get better and work on our weaknesses.

The 13 defendants who participated in the protest but were not enrolled in Columbia accepted an <a href=\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/07/25/thirteen-hamilton-hall-protesters-accept-offer-from-manhattan-da/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">offer</a> from the Manhattan DA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office that resulted in full dismissal of charges following a six-month probationary period and completion of an in-person class on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeaceful and legal protesting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Michigan Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.michiganpublic.org/criminal-justice-legal-system/2025-05-21/michigan-ag-dismisses-charges-against-remaining-three-u-of-m-pro-palestinian-protesters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dropped charges</a> against seven University of Michigan students arrested for trespass during a May 2024 pro-Palestine protest, and the LA City Attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office declined to file charges against the vast majority of the hundreds arrested at UCLA and USC campuses during the spring protests, citing insufficient evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The decision to bring <em>any</em> level of criminal charge is a question of prosecutorial discretion that most other prosecutors have elected not to pursue. But Rosen elected to bring not just misdemeanor, but <em>felony </em>charges. Both felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass charges are legally considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/wobbler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wobblers</a>,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning they could have been filed as misdemeanors. Rosen chose to seek the most punitive convictions possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Additionally, this case involves the weaponization of restitution, intended to provide financial compensation to a crime victim. The amount that Stanford is demanding is far greater than justified by any publicly available documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Facilities Director for Lands, Buildings and Real Estate, Mitch Bousson, testified that he estimates the following damages: repairs to a grandfather clock ($1,000), repairing and replacing the broken window ($2,666)<s>,</s> and repairing a doorframe and door ($6,305). His estimate comes nowhere close to the $329,000 that Stanford is demanding in restitution. Other damages were caused by Stanford law enforcement officers who forced entry into the building even after protestors communicated that they would exit peacefully, according to court filings.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The state also issued felony charges through a grand jury proceeding rather than a preliminary hearing. A grand jury proceeding is a private, secretive proceeding: only the prosecution and grand jurors were permitted to be present. The defendants had no right to appear, present evidence or cross-examine the prosecution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The grand jury hearing transcript remains closed to the public, meaning no other information on repair costs is available. Given that the restitution is set at such a high sum and would pose a significant financial burden to the students involved, Stanford and the DA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office should provide receipts or payment invoices that irrefutably prove the actual damages amount to the sum requested.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It has been over a year and a half since the occupation of the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Most other pro-Palestinian student protestors were charged at the time of their protests, over a year ago. Rosen stands alone in bringing these charges in April 2025, almost a year after the occupation happened. Defendants have been in agonizing limbo ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The students have already gone through <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2024/10/29/white-plaza-tribunal-pro-palestine-students-arrest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">disciplinary proceedings</a> brought by the University before Rosen filed charges. Students faced <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/05/29/arraignment-of-12-pro-palestine-protestors-draws-demonstrators-police-presence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">suspensions</a>, deferred degrees and loss of health care, housing and scholarship grants. They have also experienced online harassment and death threats according to their testimonies.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stanford has acted as an active collaborator in this politically-driven prosecution. The university implemented a surveillance campaign against protestors, hiring a private security firm to surveil the pro-Palestine encampment. Cameras were installed in <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/resources-for-campus-events-safety-and-well-being\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">White Plaza</a> in the context of a <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/07/increased-video-surveillance-draws-criticism-from-some-students-and-faculty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">broader effort</a> to surveil students. The University <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/156586/MAP-final-report-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">admitted</a> that they used \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccamera footage, eyewitness testimonies, and social media posts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to identify students.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a typical criminal investigation, complainants do not direct the police investigation. But according to court filings, Stanford shared disciplinary records and hearing information with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and Santa Clara DA after the occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Also according to court filings, multiple cell phones and a camera in the possession of the Stanford 11 were taken into evidence. DPS and Rosen&#8217;s office transferred these belongings to the United States Secret Service (USSS), rather than to the Santa Clara County Crime Lab, breaking from typical procedure. USSS broke through encryption to access text messages that form the basis of the felony conspiracy charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rosen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punitive prosecution and Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complicity have fused to create a legal strategy that charges protected civil disobedience as felonious behavior. We must rally in defense of the Stanford 11 and demand that DA Rosen drop the charges against them to protect the constitutional right to free speech, the right to assemble and organize and the right to demonstrate and fight for justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These students and alumni are young people with bright academic futures and entire lives ahead of them. Felony convictions will follow these students permanently, making it difficult to obtain housing and precluding them from pursuing employment and career opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To stand up for these protestors, sign this petition and take action through this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRlHj6fh3wc7nmMaaXppZetvYG4A0gqCH8IIlht8XuPs8yTMtc39zPOw-MXXn3ndgON9_Id6zhceblx/pub\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRlHj6fh3wc7nmMaaXppZetvYG4A0gqCH8IIlht8XuPs8yTMtc39zPOw-MXXn3ndgON9_Id6zhceblx/pub\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">toolkit</a>.

He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an expert maker and videographer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and with over 100 videos, his YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@3acreates/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">channel</a>, 3A Creates, shares and highlights his passion for unexpected innovation. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Liao started his channel during the pandemic. Bored by lockdown, he just wanted to experiment with putting something out there for the world to see. Liao uploaded his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG_kJ2S4fJc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first</a> YouTube video, a 30-second clip of his pet, with few expectations and felt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery surprised that a hundred people somewhere in the world cared enough to watch a video of a lizard eating a worm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From that first video, his new hobby flourished into something more serious. Combining his passion for radio-controlled cars with his video editing skills, Liao started making STEM videos where he turns innovative ideas into reality through a DIY approach. Whether 3D-printing a designer bag or building a self-driving solar rover, Liao is determined to bring his audience along every step of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think Adam has a confident expression in his videos that allows his viewers to feel his energy while enjoying the content,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Adam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend, Henry Deng \\xe2\\x80\\x9929. Through his videos, Liao embraces the process of trial and error \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and is\\xc2\\xa0unafraid to show his failures and willingness to rebuild.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe nature of building something is that there is no script to follow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don&#8217;t actually script the video before I build, I script it as I build.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This mindset is evident in a great deal of his content: in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgVx6U51J_o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> on 3D-printed wall art, for example, Liao creates multiple iterations of 3D-printed mesh, walking viewers through the process of varying the mesh holes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 size and thickness in order to create the most polished product possible. In addition to showing the trial-and-error aspect of crafting, the art of video-making and content curation is just as important to Liao.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUsually nobody wants to see you code the software for an hour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey want to see you putting [something together].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a creator, Liao cites many sources of inspiration, taking inspiration for storytelling and viewer retention from popular channels such as Ryan Trahan and Mr. Beast. Over the years, he&#8217;s become more adept at video editing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 weaving engaging sound effects, memes and varying camera angles into his videos.\\xc2\\xa0Viewers find joy in the multimedia features sprinkled throughout Liao\\xe2\\x80\\x99s channel.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bAdam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s videos help me get cultured on the freshest memes, and his relatability gives me the boost I need every week,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Adam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend, Manit Mehta \\xe2\\x80\\x9929.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As an artist developing his craft, Liao believes that when first jumping into video creation, one\\xc2\\xa0should prioritize quantity over quality. Having struggled with perfectionism in the past, he emphasized the importance of learning over pursuit of a flawless product.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon&#8217;t be afraid to put out 10 mediocre videos versus one perfect video,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou actually learn more through making 10 mediocre videos than making one perfect video.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Looking to the future, Liao is gearing up to take his passions to the next level by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiv[ing] deeper into the technical aspect of building something.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In addition to his engineering studies, he is currently undergoing training at Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Product Realization Lab, learning to use new machinery and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunlock[ing] the spectrum of things that [he] could build.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Liao also hopes to collaborate with creators at the intersection of music, film and social media in order to further his storytelling ability. Outside of his own YouTube channel, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked on many documentaries [and] music videos,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.&nbsp;\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo if anyone wants a short form content creator or social media manager, hit me up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/youtuber-adam-liao-29-breaks-down-craftsmanship-and-content-creation/\">Stanford Creates: YouTuber Adam Liao \\xe2\\x80\\x9929 breaks down craftsmanship and content creation\\xc2\\xa0</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/youtuber-adam-liao-29-breaks-down-craftsmanship-and-content-creation/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279864</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Surreal @ Stanford: Mid Terms</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/surreal-stanford-mid-terms/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/surreal-stanford-mid-terms/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Tanya Rastogi]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 02:07:28 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[The Grind]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[grass]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[mid]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[mid term]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[midterm season]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[midterms]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[outside]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stress]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279855</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>How can midterm season stretch far beyond the middle of a quarter?

Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a first In-N-Out order or the sudden feeling of inadequacy, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all undergone new things since our arrival. In this column, Tanya Rastogi \\xe2\\x80\\x9929 seeks to explore that liminality.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is used in many ways. Originally, it was a prefix referring to the middle of something, like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmid-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmid-October.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Recent internet language has shifted its connotation to something more like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmediocre\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 below average, boring, unappealing. In Stanford terms, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is eternity. It is Week 4. It is Week 6. It is Week 8.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My professors really enjoy the phrase &#8220;midterm season&#8221; \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great catch-all for every stressor a student could experience. Midterm season is the veil of reasoning applied to the dead silence in the lecture hall after a question. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the explanation for dark circles and messy dorm rooms and, hell, the darkness that now blankets campus at 5 p.m.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Midterm season. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that sound so heavy?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When over half the quarter is spent preparing for impending exams, the weight of this term can be reduced or bloated. One one hand, if everything is midterms, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so bad, right? But then it<em> </em>is indeed so bad, and frosh with the light still in their eyes realize that they have 11 quarters remaining of this.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rationale for this sadistic schedule (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at the chemistry department in particular; my friends in the 31 series have suffered greatly) is unclear. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already on a quarter system. Our temporal perception of a school year has already been stretched by 50%. Why must that year be pulled further by the claws of deadlines and late-night study sessions and Canvas notifications that are somehow always sent out during the function?&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The afternoon a few days before my exams \\xe2\\x80\\x94 both conveniently on the same date \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I sat outside at the tables in front of Tresidder. I needed to get out of my dorm, where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be distracted, and the libraries, where I was undergoing a hibernative transformation induced by fluorescent lighting and dry stuffy air. I figured that if my exams would have me staring into a laptop screen for hours on end, the least I could do for myself was let myself see the sun.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In my ears blasted the same playlist that had been running on repeat for the past two hours. It cycled through the final song, and I ran it back from the beginning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCalifornia Dreamin\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d kicked in with its first wistful plucks of guitar. <em>All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray \\xe2\\x80\\xa6</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A light breeze grazed my skin, ruffled the leaves below me. Traces of laughter from the surrounding tables broke faintly through the music. Above my head, the clouds were wispy and white. All the leaves were orange, and the sky was blue, so blue.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For just one instance, all my troubles evaporated to the warm air.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\xa6&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Maybe this is what happens when Stanford students touch grass. Maybe midterms have us all delirious. Whatever it is, there is more than life to academics. Go outside.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/surreal-stanford-mid-terms/\">Surreal @ Stanford: Mid Terms</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/surreal-stanford-mid-terms/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279855</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Stanfordle #040 (Nov. 14, 2025)</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/stanfordle-040-nov-14-2025/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/stanfordle-040-nov-14-2025/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Eliza Krackeler]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:56:01 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanfordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[fun]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[game]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[puzzle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[puzzles]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stanfordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[word]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[word game]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[word games]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[wordle]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[words]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1278805</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Enjoy The Daily\\'s Stanfordle, the newest part of our Games section.

campus, dominating our skyline in a metaphor for the political power that permeates society.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It may seem counterintuitive that the largest landmark at a school known for its stellar sciences and proximity to Silicon Valley is not tech-oriented. In 1941, the tower was commissioned by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover to <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/visit-us-hoover-tower#:~:text=Commissioned%20by%20Herbert%20Hoover%20and,that%20strengthen%20a%20free%20society.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">house</a> \\xe2\\x80\\x9crare library and archival materials.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over 80 years later, I now frequent the tower as a student fellow at the Hoover Institute and am equally invested in government through my political science major. And so, I was recently disappointed to see a <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/05/passionate-panels-empty-lawn-democracy-day-sees-low-turnout-at-meyer-green-amid-and-international-fears-and-apathy/\">news piece</a> from The Daily on the apparent apathy students felt towards political engagement and the low attendance for Democracy Day panels and events on Meyer Green last week.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I was on one of those panels, and we discussed the First Amendment, a relevant and contentious issue on most college campuses. The panel held voices across the political spectrum, including me and Jennifer Levine &#8217;28, the co-managing editors of The Daily\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Opinions section, Joe Nail MBA &#8217;26, the founder and president of the America Club and Robert Liu &#8217;28, the vice president of Stanford College Democrats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The low turnout wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a hit to my ego. I enjoyed the conversation with the other panelists, and I attributed the sparse audience to a busy midterm season, tired students and, hopefully, off-campus voting.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not so sure the low turnout for events on Meyer Green that day accurately reflected the entire Stanford student body. The night of Democracy Day, I attended Dine and Dialogue, an event that brought together faculty and students through engaging political discussion. Unlike earlier programming, the event was so packed that I, along with several other students, had to wait for more chairs to be brought in. Some students had to stand next to tables to join the conversation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Student interest in government isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just limited to Democracy Day, either. When Gov. Ron DeSantis came to <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/ron-desantis-hoover-institution-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speak</a>, the auditorium was filled, and most students were unable to get access to the event. The classes I take as a political science major are usually so popular that professors have long waitlists, and the discipline provides unparalleled access to professionals working in government.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although computer science is the most <a href=\"https://www.ivywise.com/blog/top-10-most-popular-majors-at-stanford/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">common</a> major at Stanford, political science and international relations also rank in the ten most <a href=\"https://www.ivywise.com/blog/top-10-most-popular-majors-at-stanford/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popular</a> majors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a testament to Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s robust academic political scene, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in an American intelligence class taught by Amy Zegart called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpies, Lies, and Algorithms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had the privilege of hearing from guest speaker Christopher Wray, the former director of the FBI. This past weekend, the entire class engaged in a day-long intelligence simulation where we worked in teams acting as different intelligence agencies (what the intelligence community calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwargames\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). A class with roughly 100 students waking up at 8 a.m. participating in a simulation on a Saturday does not signal apathy. It demonstrates a deep passion for policy and government.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have spaces for liberals, moderates and conservatives. The Hoover Institute, although officially nonpartisan, has a reputation for <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hoover-Institution-on-War-Revolution-and-Peace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conservative</a> leanings. Students on The Stanford Review<em> </em>staff feel Stanford <a href=\"https://stanfordreview.org/what-conservatives-get-out-of-college/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offers more</a> to conservatives than the Ivies do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But unlike the Ivies or other top East Coast schools, Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political fervor feels limited to the minority of students actively engaged in politics. The dominating culture on campus feels largely apolitical. Policy obviously affects our personal rights and interests. And yet, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed that aside from ultra-significant issues like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abortion</a>, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often hard to feel like policy matters in our isolated Stanford bubble. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Involvement in government is still essential for everyone. Although I study political science, am a Hoover undergraduate research fellow and remain engaged in the campus political scene, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t plan on starting my career in Washington. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m invested in politics because, while I pursue other professional interests, from finance and media to consumer retail and real estate, policy remains steadfastly intertwined in everything I do. Financial markets are tied to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/14/business/dealbook/rebuild-gaza-cost.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">geopolitical</a> events, such as the Middle East crisis in Gaza.  The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">media</a> is not always safe from governmental powers. <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/tariff-driven-consumer-behavior-shifts-reshaping-retail-consumer-goods-markets-2025-2508/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consumer and retail patterns</a> are shaped by tariffs implemented by new administrations. Real estate regulations limit both <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbnb-faces-regulatory-challenges-amid-110834494.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">platforms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/new-york-city-commercial-real-estate-industry-seeks-work-with-mamdani-rent-2025-11-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">properties</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Computer science majors, too, should be engaged in government. Artificial intelligence (AI) <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/ai/recent-efforts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">policy</a> is crucial to the future of the technology sector, and the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-024-02175-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">startup world</a> is reliant on public policy. The longest government shutdown might have finally ended because of a reopening deal involving <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/is-obamacare-ending-what-government-shutdown-deal-means-for-health-care-11023774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthcare policy</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The basis for all these disciplines \\xe2\\x80\\x94 university research \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is very political. In 2024, a Daily <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2024/02/01/behind-the-1-98-billion-in-stanfords-external-research-funds/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMost%20people%20think%20that%20Stanford,t%20good%20at%20developing%20technology.%E2%80%9D\">article</a> found that 75% of Stanford&#8217;s 7,500 research projects were funded by the U.S. government.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Policy is embedded within all disciplines and professions. I urge Stanford students to take this to heart \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and turn that conviction into action. No matter what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re studying or what your post-grad plans are, policy will always be relevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m almost certain that the political science major won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t surpass computer science anytime soon. And next year, my feelings won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be hurt if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up to the panel discussions, even if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m speaking. My wish for the Stanford community is for all students to see the value in increasing their engagement in government and understanding the relationship between policy and their interests.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To create lasting impact, we must realize that policy transcends the ballot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical to everything we do.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/gottlieb-policy-may-not-be-your-major-but-it-governs-your-reality/\">Gottlieb | Policy may not be your major, but it governs your reality</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/gottlieb-policy-may-not-be-your-major-but-it-governs-your-reality/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279792</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>UGS affirms conditional collaboration with OCS, supports reinstatement of land acknowledgement</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/ugs-collaboration-with-ocs-resolution/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/ugs-collaboration-with-ocs-resolution/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Rebecca Byers]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:31:17 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Featured]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[bill]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[club sports council]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[land acknowledgement]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[OCS]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[OCS reform]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[SAIO]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[student government]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[UGS]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Undergraduate senate]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279825</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Undergraduate Senate emphasized its support for Office of Community Standards reform and passed a bill supporting the reinstatement of land acknowledgements at their Wednesday meeting. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/13/ugs-collaboration-with-ocs-resolution/\">UGS affirms conditional collaboration with OCS, supports reinstatement of land acknowledgement</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>In its Wednesday meeting, the Undergraduate Senate (UGS) <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsYBmF_ZEp10143H4xL-l7OY6dbZ-_3NhSoVFgDXbo4/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed</a> a bill confirming its continued collaboration with the Office of Community Standards (OCS) and called for the reinstatement of University land acknowledgements. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The UGS&#8217; collaboration with OCS also includes the Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) and is conditional on meaningful progress towards OCS reform this year. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Joint Bill Affirming Conditional Collaboration With the Office of Community Standards (OCS) and Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) stated that if progress is not made, nominations to future conduct panels may not be approved. As examples of desired reforms, the bill cited increased communication and better mechanisms for enforcing speedy investigation timelines.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy primary view of this bill is that it is giving prior notice to the administration and OCS of levers that we do have, reminding them of that and what we expect out of a system that they expect us to be complicit in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of the bill&#8217;s authors, Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) executive vice president Will Berriman &#8217;26 said.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The UGS also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmPcftKfMNhWw2UAF1EEbWKkwbuUYVtzwlrsavN4-6M/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed</a> the Joint Resolution to Support the Reinstatement of Stanford University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Land Acknowledgement.

Read the latest in this week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Research Roundup.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modeling human brain development with assembloids</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stanford neuroscientist Sergiu Pasca, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and <a href=\"https://www.brainorganogenesis.org/team.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">director</a> of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis Program, is pioneering the use of lab-grown \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmini brains,&#8221; also <a href=\"https://stanmed.stanford.edu/brain-tissue-assembloids-expand-brain-understanding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">known</a> as assembloids, to explore how the human brain develops and functions.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe human brain largely builds itself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pasca said, describing how various brain organoids will self-organize and form connections when placed together in a dish. When organoids fuse in this way, they become assembloids, which researchers can use to model specific brain regions.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By creating assembloids, Pasca and his lab team can study how different brain regions form connections, a process that was once impossible to observe directly.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Pasca emphasizes that these models are tools, not complete brains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn assembloid is not a brain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a working model of some of the circuitry resident in a living, functioning human brain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Researchers at the Pasca Lab use assembloids to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as Timothy syndrome, a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder that causes neurological disorders and autism. These studies are helping researchers understand how genetic mutations alter brain development.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While questions remain regarding the ethics of creating complex human neural systems, including how far scientists can go in modeling consciousness, Pasca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research marks a major step toward understanding and potentially treating the human brain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most elusive disorders.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sweet spot for online loading</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nobody likes to wait \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa0and especially online. But new <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/online-content-loading-animations-speed-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a> from the Graduate School of Business (GSB) suggests that the right kind of animation can make digital delays feel shorter and keep users from clicking away.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a series of studies led by Yu Ding, assistant professor of marketing at the GSB, and Ellie Kyung, a researcher at Babson College, researchers found that moderate-speed animations, as opposed to static images or rapid animations, can significantly reduce perceived page load wait time and improve user engagement.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The findings were inspired by a moment of irritation. When Ding noticed how a lingering logo on his TV made him want to change the channel, he became curious about how brands could keep users engaged during unavoidable pauses online.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Across experiments involving more than 1,400 participants, moderate-speed animations consistently led to better outcomes. In one test, Facebook users were more likely to wait through a 20-second page load if shown a moderately moving image. In another, participants who saw moderate animations during a short wait were more likely to complete a task and reported higher satisfaction with products they viewed afterward.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The results point to a simple, low-cost way for companies to improve digital experiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf something is moving too slowly, people just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay attention\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The middle point is the sweet spot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ding said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI rivals humans in political persuasion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) may be just as convincing as humans when it comes to politics, according to new <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/ai-generated-political-messages-persuasion-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a> from the GSB.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Robb Willer, professor of sociology and organizational behavior at the GSB (by courtesy), and Zakary Tormala, the Laurence W. Lane professor of behavioral science and marketing at the GSB, led complementary studies examining how people respond to political messages written by AI compared to those written by humans.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Willer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team found that AI-generated messages were equally persuasive across a range of policy issues, including gun control, carbon taxes and voter registration. Participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinions shifted similarly regardless of whether messages came from people or machines.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tormala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research revealed a striking twist: when participants were told that a message came from AI, they were more open to opposing viewpoints. People perceived AI as less biased and more informed than human messengers, making them more receptive to counterarguments and more likely to share or seek out information that challenged their beliefs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The findings suggest that AI could be used to reduce political polarization by presenting information in ways people trust more.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were thinking AI might sometimes do better than human sources in this context because people believe AI has no persuasive intent, is not inherently biased and has access to a wealth of information,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tormala told the Stanford Report.\\xc2\\xa0However, the same psychological effect could also enable the spread of misinformation, Tormala warned.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/research-roundup-mini-brains-and-mindful-design/\">Research Roundup: &#8216;mini brains&#8217; and mindful design</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/research-roundup-mini-brains-and-mindful-design/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279806</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Her POV: Who gets to survive \\xe2\\x80\\x98A House Of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the United States?</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/who-gets-to-survive-a-house-of-dynamite-in-the-united-states/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/who-gets-to-survive-a-house-of-dynamite-in-the-united-states/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Blyss Cleveland]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 07:40:16 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Screen]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Arts & Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[a house of dynamite]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Bigelow]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[intelligence]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Movie]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[movie review]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[national security]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[nonproliferation]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[nuclear]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[nuclear attack]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[political thriller]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[POTUS]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[power dynamics]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[surveillance]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[U.S.]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279782</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Director Kathryn Bigelow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest film, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explores the fallout from a nuclear attack on a major U.S. city, zeroing in on how power operates among the powerful. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/who-gets-to-survive-a-house-of-dynamite-in-the-united-states/\">Her POV: Who gets to survive \\xe2\\x80\\x98A House Of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the United States?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>In the event of a nuclear attack on a major city in the United States, who will be sacrificed? And who will be saved?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2025), directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is set in a post-post-Cold War era where world powers have reneged on their commitments to nuclear non-proliferation. After an intercontinental ballistic missile is launched from across the Pacific Ocean, several government agencies must coordinate their response, and what begins as an ordinary day transforms into a series of high-wire decisions.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I was drawn to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for its star-studded cast, despite feeling skeptical at the prospect of a political thriller from Bigelow. Her previous films include \\xe2\\x80\\x9cZero Dark Thirty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2012) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Hurt Locker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2009), with the latter film earning her Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Although Bigelow has been lauded for her slice-of-life approach to war and foreign policy, movies that depict America as a global peacekeeper require too much suspension of disbelief for me. The U.S. has been an instigator in many conflicts, and the best storytelling acknowledges this complex reality. Fortunately, though America is under siege in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the film largely avoids jingoism, excelling when it zeroes in on how power operates among the powerful.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The story begins with minimal exposition. The action moves quickly through the alphabet soup of operational security agencies and the ensemble members who first notice the unidentified object hurtling across the Pacific Ocean \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a pace which helps establish the vastness of the security apparatus. Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) tasks her husband with tending to their son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fever while she heads into work at the White House Situation Room, seamlessly swapping her sensible sneakers for nude pumps as she goes through security. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) worker Cathy Rogers (Moses Ingram) attends to a personal matter involving a divorce attorney during her commute. Meanwhile, Major Gonzalez (Anthony Ramos) marches into the command center in Fort Greely, Alaska and chides a colleague for eating in a restricted area. The most levelheaded taskmasters begin to falter as the DEFCON level drops. Once it becomes clear the unidentified object is a weapon, the available avenues of response hardly seem ideal. According to the Deputy National Security Advisor (Gabriel Basso), the U.S. might have to hit a bullet with a bullet. But will the destruction of the weapon cause more collateral damage than it prevents?\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the core of Bigelow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work is power \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how it functions and who benefits from it. Beyond the insignia on the various military branch uniforms, authority is displayed in subtle and interesting ways. The Deputy National Security Advisor takes an Uber to work to serve the president, who is chauffeured from various locales and walks through doors that are opened for him. Individuals such as General Brady (Tracy Letts) stride into rooms where everyone stands at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttention!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d until given permission to sit. When the top brass is around, the comfort level of their subordinates is subject to their desires.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though military service is often heralded as a selfless act, most of the powerbrokers in this universe make life or death decisions knowing their families won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be collateral. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, a title alone doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee safety. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Bigelow&#8217;s universe, the POTUS (Idris Elba) and the First Lady (Ren\\xc3\\xa9e Elise Goldsberry) are Black, and people of color are extremely well-represented at the different echelons of government. Despite this, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Elba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portrayed as knowledgeable but the coterie of his white advisors. The adage \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiverse faces in high places won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t save anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d becomes salient, as it is primarily white men who are identified as designated evacuees and whisked safely out of command rooms. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d puts people of color in positions of power, only to undermine their authority and humanity, which is not helped by the film\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to provide these characters with fully realized emotional arcs.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This film\\xe2\\x80\\x99s screenplay was written by NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, who is no stranger to dystopian and political work, having penned films such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJackie\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2016) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Maze Runner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2014). Here, Oppenheim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing is effective, if somewhat redundant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shifts between characters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perspectives, painting a picture filled in by different points of view. Though this initially enables the viewer to share in the characters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 confusion, the film loses its initial nail-biting momentum by Act Three as the film traces over the same lines rather than adding detail. Establishing shots and subtitles contextualize each location before Bigelow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immersive handheld camerawork takes over, but keeping viewers informed of their whereabouts doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide a purpose for being there.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the film has its moments. Interludes of stillness are well-earned, and the moment when intelligence expert Ana Park (Greta Lee) is looped into the decision-making process is particularly arresting. In the scene, Ana has taken her son to the 162nd reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg. As she discusses the likelihood that the threat originated from North Korea, the sound of bullets and cannons echo in the background, a blunt force commentary on our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tendency to worry about external threats while ignoring internal ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is sometimes a shame that so many details from our world are used in this alternate universe, as certain elements stretch the bounds of incredulity. Captain Holt is asked to provide a list of names and social security numbers in the event this escalates to war. Surely, a nation that operates one of the most advanced surveillance apparatuses isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in need of a document that would be incinerated by a nuclear warhead? When POTUS looks for his gold code card, he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Codes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retrieves</a> it from his pocket along with a few stray bills. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes the president <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-29668094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carry</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/09/donald-trump-pocket-cash?srsltid=AfmBOoprepIrOXpg7sLCTus8CRLSfp23jkwt2iuy-yMsJ-B51pXfJMhF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash</a>?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the first thing I searched after I left the theater.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA House of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a Netflix film. It was given a limited theatrical release before being made available on the streaming service, presumably to ensure it qualifies for awards consideration. However, it would not surprise me if this film is overlooked in the major award categories, as it poses difficult questions about the ethical implications of using citizens as collateral damage. It is not the kind of narrative that earns accolades, but it does provide a heartpounding viewing experience.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/who-gets-to-survive-a-house-of-dynamite-in-the-united-states/\">Her POV: Who gets to survive \\xe2\\x80\\x98A House Of Dynamite\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the United States?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/who-gets-to-survive-a-house-of-dynamite-in-the-united-states/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279782</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>How to corner your MIA faculty advisor</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/how-to-corner-your-mia-faculty-advisor/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/how-to-corner-your-mia-faculty-advisor/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ocheze Amuzie]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 07:18:16 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Humor]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[academic advising]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Academics]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[comedy]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[faculty advisor]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[grad school]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[grad school difficult]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[haha very funny]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[humor]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[humorous]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[joke]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[jokes]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[major]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[mia]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[thesis]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279704</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Let\\'s explore some creative ways to secure some much-needed alone time with your one-and-only.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/how-to-corner-your-mia-faculty-advisor/\">How to corner your MIA faculty advisor</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p><em>Editor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Note: This article is purely satirical and fictitious.

You can get creative.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You also have to make sure to leave food and water in the pit (6\\xe2\\x80\\x99 x 6\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is best), most likely in the form of nutrient pellets and one of those little squirt bottles for guinea pigs. Make it feel homey, lay down a rug. At least then no one can say you&#8217;re inhumane (at least not by R&amp;DE standards).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Send a fake email pretending their latest grant application was approved</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nothing gets a weary academic raring and ready to go like cold hard cash, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen many a tenured professor get downright reckless chasing funds. It may seem unethical, but remember: you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a Stanford student. You can simply write ethics out of the equation, then lie about your character later. No problem!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, this option does come with some mild risks. You can pull this bait-and-switch off once, <em>maybe</em> twice before your advisor is legally allowed to commit physical violence against you as an act of self-preservation. They really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play when coin is involved.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Catfish them as a foxy undergrad in their area looking for a good time</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, now, this may elicit some understandable knee-jerk reactions, but hear me out. Think of it like a public service \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if they fall for your ruse, you can post all of your DMs and cancel them on Twitter (Bluesky? Nah, Twitter), which, as a bonus, could free up a lot more of their precious time. You may also go to jail for fraud or extortion or whatever, but we&#8217;re talking about your academic career. You&#8217;ve got to do a cost-benefit analysis of the situation and come to your own conclusions.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Line the halls of their entire building with honey and extra-strength fly paper</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If they go to their office as much as my advisor does (never), you might find this tactic bears more fruit than <strong>#1</strong>. In fact, you can catch anyone you want within a whole department this way. Use a long stick with a big, big net at the end to scoop up any unnecessary extras and trap them in an office (you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to make sure you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already borrowed a key from the super nice/didn&#8217;t-really-give-a-shit night maintenance guy) so that they can&#8217;t alert the next wave of faculty walking into their fate. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother with the food and ambience in this one; department staff are scrappy and can work it out themselves.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>5. Offer their children candy, kidnap them and hold them for ransom.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I already know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking: <em>Woah, woah\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 whimsical Scooby-Doo traps and victimless cybercrimes are one thing, but surely kidnapping kids crosses the line?</em> My friend, this is your graduation we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about. This is war. And all is fair in the pursuit of diplomas and war. And some other third thing, maybe.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If this seems daunting, study the titular scene from Liam Neeson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2008 blockbuster \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTaken\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for practical tips on getting the job done (as well as style inspiration). You can never go wrong in black!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Less creative folks might tell you that you can just send an email and ask for their office hours, but everyone knows any faculty advisor worth their tenure checks their inbox once a month, <em>max</em>, even less frequently for emails from students. But these tactics, however &#8220;overcomplicated&#8221; or &#8220;legally distasteful,&#8221; have been empirically proven in the field to get results, guaranteed.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Happy hunting!</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/how-to-corner-your-mia-faculty-advisor/\">How to corner your MIA faculty advisor</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/how-to-corner-your-mia-faculty-advisor/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279704</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>When the neurologist works from home\\xc2\\xa0</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/when-the-neurologist-works-from-home/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/when-the-neurologist-works-from-home/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Nadia Kirmani]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 06:57:52 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[The Grind]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[father stroke]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[healthcare reform]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[healthcare system]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[hospital]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[medical student]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[neurologist]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[neurology]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[ongoign recovery]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[patient care]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford Medical School]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[stroke]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279737</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>After her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stroke, medical student Nadia Kirmani was struck by the gaps in patient care she witnessed, prompting this testimony on how the healthcare system can do more. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/when-the-neurologist-works-from-home/\">When the neurologist works from home\\xc2\\xa0</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour father had a stroke.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words came out clipped, with a foreign quality that was equal parts fear and disbelief. I had just gotten off from the hospital after a long call day on my internal medicine rotation. It was a sticky California afternoon, and I was parked outside my apartment, impatiently waiting for my exhaustion to wear off. My mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice seemed even further away than the nearly 3,000 miles that separated us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I turned the word <em>stroke</em> over and over in my mind, a word that had once felt hypothetical, for which I drew up lists of potential etiologies and crammed treatment plans the night before exams. I saw it up close with beloved patients who unexpectedly lost the ability to move their arms or form fluent sentences overnight. Even then, I never could have seen it coming. \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bAs I boarded the plane home, uncertain whether the man I had known my entire life was the same one waiting for me, I went over memories with my father with the same religiosity that comes with reciting a prayer you haven&#8217;t turned to in years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My father was taken to the nearest stroke center in our hometown: a for-profit hospital in the suburbs of Longwood, FL. As a medical student, I stared at the penumbra on his CT scan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the area of brain tissue that was reversibly injured, around the unsalvageable ischemic core \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I wondered how much viable tissue was lost because we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know his \\xe2\\x80\\x9clast known normal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d making him ineligible for a clot-busting agent. As his daughter, I looked at his brain and, tracing the folds on the screen with my fingers, I wondered how many memories of our family \\xe2\\x80\\x94 growing up and old, through birthdays and graduations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had now vanished.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What struck me most during my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hospitalization was the fact that when his neurologist saw him, it was over telehealth. My father was never seen once in-person by a neurologist during his stay. I knew from my training that certain neurological exams, such as testing cranial nerves, assessing muscular strength and evaluating reflexes, could not be performed through a screen effectively. The neurologist declared a diagnosis of global aphasia and proposed speech therapy as the only path forward. As my mother held my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 her husband for the last thirty-three years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she wondered if he would ever be able to say her name again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The day my father was discharged marked the beginning of a grueling recovery period. My father, a boisterous Pakistani man and former psychiatrist, was now struggling to name household objects and rehearsing American idioms, many of which he was learning for the first time. Previously, his livelihood revolved around language. It was how he climbed into the window of his patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 minds to understand the context around their disease and their personhood beyond a set of symptoms. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first week was the toughest. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUseless,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, half anger, half pity. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t open the language exercise book for another week.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After a stroke, follow-up neurologic care is critical to prevent secondary complications. My father was given a referral for a local neurologist when he was discharged. The neurologist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earliest availability was in six months. We were located in what I later learned to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneurologist desert.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a consequence of where we lived, either. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nationwide shortage of neurologists. A study by the 2024 Association of American Medical Colleges <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/media/75231/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">estimated</a> that by 2036, there will be a deficit of approximately 37,000 full-time neurologists.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Without timely access to specialists, stroke patients like my father face delays that can lead to devastating outcomes. A week after discharge, he was re-hospitalized for a five millimeter midline shift, a sign that his brain was swelling to a dangerous level. He spent another week in the hospital to manage his symptoms. On discharge, he had an appointment scheduled for the upcoming week \\xe2\\x80\\x94 again, via telehealth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story is not unique. As America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population ages, the prevalence of chronic neurological conditions including stroke, dementia and Parkinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease is surging. Stroke incidence alone is <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0b013e31829734f2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected</a> to reach 20% by 2030. However, many communities lack even a single neurologist. Consequently, patients must wait months for follow-up and are often re-hospitalized in the interim, hospitals rely heavily on teleconsultations and families are largely left to manage rehabilitation plans on their own.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Watching my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gaps in care as he struggled to regain speech after his stroke changed the way I saw the healthcare system. It made me realize that we need early and sustained investment in training neurologists to address our national shortage. As a medical student myself, I have seen firsthand how early exposure to a specialty can shape a student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career trajectory. If medical schools introduce neurology earlier in curriculums and support students with incentives such as loan forgiveness, more trainees may enter neurology over more lucrative specialties. Most importantly, <a href=\"https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Advance_Data_Tables_2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increasing</a> the number of residency positions from a meager 1,160 spots and strengthening community-based programs would ensure families like mine are not left waiting months for in-person care.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recovery is ongoing, oscillating between frustration and progress, with every language deficit regained like a feat that once seemed cruelly unattainable. His story teaches me that policy must take shape from abstract conversations into tangible reform that recognizes neurologic care as more than an afterthought. That way, when our loved ones inevitably become neurology patients, they will receive equitable, high quality healthcare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in person rather than behind a screen.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/when-the-neurologist-works-from-home/\">When the neurologist works from home\\xc2\\xa0</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/when-the-neurologist-works-from-home/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279737</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Reconnect Stanford imagines a campus without social media</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/reconnect-stanford-socialmedia-delete/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/reconnect-stanford-socialmedia-delete/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mara Hankins]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 06:05:14 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[connection]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[deletion]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Instagram]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[loneliness]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[phones]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[reconnect stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[social media]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279772</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>At Stanford\\'s first \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmass social media deletion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d event, the student organization encouraged students to begin their journeys of \"social media sobriety.\" </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/reconnect-stanford-socialmedia-delete/\">Reconnect Stanford imagines a campus without social media</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToxic poison.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo consuming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy engagements were inauthentic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These were some of the testimonials <a href=\"https://weunplugged.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">written</a> on Tuesday night by students who gathered at On Call Caf\\xc3\\xa9 for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmass social media deletion event\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hosted by Reconnect Stanford, a student organization, <a href=\"https://weunplugged.org/manifesto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">committed</a> to encouraging and supporting students through \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial media sobriety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By the end of the night, 25 students had quit social media and added their names to a growing list of objectors.

I&#8217;ve never heard of somebody deleting TikTok and regretting it. It just doesn&#8217;t happen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Co-founder Truitt Flink &#8217;28 deleted social media a year ago and felt the positive impacts of her decision ever since. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realized I was missing out on moments in my life, moments that were only being viewed through a screen or through a falsified version of them that I was later going to craft and post on my feed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flink said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat mattered more to me than the real moment, and I didn&#8217;t want that to be the case anymore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Eight weeks into her first year at Stanford, Allegra Bockhaus &#8217;29 felt there was no longer a place for social media in her life, she said. Bockhaus deleted TikTok at Reconnect Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s event.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realized how many opportunities there are [in college], and I want to take every opportunity and live life to the fullest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Allegra said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel like social media holds people back from that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other students expressed similar sentiments, including Diya Bhattacharjee &#8217;28, who deleted Instagram on Tuesday night. Bhattacharjee said that social media felt like a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccloud hanging over\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her head, and she felt tired of considering how she was being perceived online.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mental space is the most valuable thing I have,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bhattacharjee said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone else [online] is taking that away from me, and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deserve to do that. If I want to live the most fulfilling life, I need to use my brain to my full capacity, which can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen when I have social media.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In speaking with students at Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s event, Flink and Botvinick found that most people dislike the role social media plays in their lives. Student testimonials acknowledge apps like TikTok and Instagram as a time drain and a source of anxiety. However, most social media users find a reason to keep it downloaded, whether to stay in touch with long-distance friends or follow news and campus events. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Botvinick likes to point out to students on the fence about deleting their accounts that the ability to do those things predates social media.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When she represents Reconnect Stanford, Flink said she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to tell students what to do or how to live their lives. Instead, she said she poses a thought experiment: imagine yourself on your deathbed confronted with the way you chose to spend your life. If you have regrets or unfulfilled goals, imagine how that would change if you could get your time spent scrolling back.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Reconnect Stanford aims to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike Alcoholics Anonymous for social media,&#8221; Flink said. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe created Reconnect Stanford to empower people to continue making this choice every day and to be with people who have made the same choice, because that&#8217;s how addictions work,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flink said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to have a support network.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the future, Reconnect Stanford hopes to have a row house for their growing community. They envision a space that fosters connection, where people engage with one another at all hours of the day instead of scrolling.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, leadership members missed the application window to establish a theme house, and the University only reopens applications every four years.

Field hockey ended their season in disappointing fashion, men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tennis qualified athletes for NCAA tournament play, women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rowing had its first and only competition of the fall and home basketball games have started. Women&#8217;s soccer was the highlight of the week after they won the ACC title and secured a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Field hockey</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stanford field hockey&#8217;s postseason run ended in disappointment last week when they fell 3-4 to No. 2 Virginia in the ACC tournament. Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals came from freshman Summer Knight-Thomas, fifth year Maroussia Walckiers and sophomore Nadine Brenninkmeyer. Ultimately the Cardinal fell short, unable to make a game tying goal in the closing minutes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tennis</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Graduate student Alex Chang and sophomore Alex Razeghi competed at the ITA sectional championships in Berkeley, both as individuals and as a double. In doubles play they went 3-1, successfully qualifying for the NCAA Doubles Championships in Orlando, Florida from Nov. 18-23.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tennis</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Freshman Alyssa Ahn went 6-0 at the ITA sectional championships in Berkeley, decisively beating Naomi Xu of Cal 6-0, 6-1 to take home the singles title. Ahn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory qualifies her to compete in the NCAA Championships in Orlando on Nov. 18-23. Notably, this is the second year in a row that a Stanford freshman has won the single section championship, following the win of Valerie Glozman in 2024, and the 13th time in the last 15 years that a Stanford athlete has won the tournament.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soccer</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 1 women&#8217;s soccer played twice last week as they took part in the ACC tournament. On Thursday they played a semifinal match against No. 7 Virginia. After scoring three first-half goals, courtesy of sophomore Charlotte Kohler, who scored twice, and senior Jasmine Aikey, Stanford was able to hold on in the second half for a 3-2 victory. On Sunday, they beat No. 2 Notre Dame in an all-time classic ACC Championship match that ultimately had to be decided in penalties. Sophomore Charlotte Kohler clinched the ACC title with a sixth-round penalty kick. With the victory Stanford earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament and will host Cal Poly on Friday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soccer</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 2 men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soccer also played twice last week. On Wednesday, they beat No. 15 Boston College in a 4-2 comeback win in the first round of the ACC tournament. In the second round of the tournament on Sunday, Stanford fell 1-0 to the No. 7 SMU Mustangs. SMU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lone goal came off of a second-half penalty kick. The 48-team NCAA Tournament seeding will be announced on Monday, Nov. 17. Until then Stanford will return to The Farm to recover and prepare for the tournament.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water polo</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 3 men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water polo played twice last week and won both games. On Wednesday they beat No. 17 Santa Clara 17-9. Redshirt freshman Max Zelikov and junior Alex Gheorghe both recorded hat tricks in the game. On Sunday, the Card beat No. 6 Pacific 16-7 to close out their regular season home schedule. Sophomore Botond Balogh led scoring with four goals. The Cardinal will have their final regular season match this coming weekend, against No. 4 Cal in the annual Big Splash.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swimming and diving&nbsp;</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 8 Stanford men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swimming and diving had a successful outing at the annual Triple Distance Meet this week in Berkley. The Card ended up <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/stanford-splits-wins-in-meet-with-cal/\">taking home</a> eight victories courtesy of six different athletes on the day. Junior Henry McFadden secured a win in the 200 fly, senior Andres Dupont Cabrera won in both the 100 and 200 free, senior Liam Custer was the first to reach the wall in the 400 IM, junior Gibson Holmes was victorious in the 200 IM, sophomore Finn Harland one both the 50 and 100 yard backstroke and junior Johnathan Tan won the 50 free, part of a podium sweep for the Cardinal. Up next, the team heads to Austin, Texas next week for the annual Texas Diving Invite.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swimming and diving</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 3 Stanford women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swimming and diving was dominant at the same annual Triple Distance Meet in Berkley. The Card was victorious in 10 events on the day. Senior Gigi Johnson won the 200 free, sophomore Levenia Sim won 50 and 100 back, junior Caroline Bricker took the 200 back, junior Lucy Thomas won the 50 breast and senior Lucy Bell took both the 100 and the 200 breast. Redshirt senior, and reigning Olympic champion in the 100 fly, Torri Huske swept the IM category winning the 100-, 200-, and 400-meter races. Next week the team will travel to Texas for the Texas swimming and diving invites Nov. 13-22.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basketball</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basketball played at home twice last week. On Tuesday, they beat Portland State 89-79. Freshman Ebuka Okorie and senior Chisom Okpara scored 26 and 21 respectively. On Saturday, they were back at it against Montana State in the game that ended with a final score of 91-68 in favor of the Card. The offense was led by another impressive performance from Okorie, who put up 29 points. Senior Benny Gealer, redshirt sophomore Aidan Cammann and graduate student AJ Rohosy also all had double-digit scoring nights. The Cardinal are back in action Wednesday night at home against Montana.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basketball</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basketball was a perfect three-for-three last week at home. On Monday, they won their season opener against UNC Greensboro 87-42. Stanford had five players put up double- digits in points to open the season. On Thursday they were back at it against Santa Clara who they <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/09/stanford-rides-hot-hands-to-win/\">beat</a> 79-58. Two freshmen, Lara Somfai and Alexandra Eschmeyer, recorded double-doubles on the night. In the final game of the week on Sunday, the Card dominated Cal Poly in a 90-55 win. Junior Nunu Agara led the team in scoring with 16 points and seven rebounds. Stanford has its first road test this Friday against Washington State.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wrestling</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 19 Stanford traveled to Stillwater, Okla. on Friday and fell to No. 5 Oklahoma State 33-7. Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only wins came from redshirt sophomore Tyler Knox, and redshirt freshman Aden Valencia. Knox improved to 2-0 on the season and is currently ranked No. 6 nationally in the 133-pound class. Valencia, currently ranked No. 18 in the 149-pound class, successfully defeated No. 2 Casey Swiderski in a 13-3 major decision. Stanford will travel to face California Baptist on Saturday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volleyball</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No. 5 women&#8217;s volleyball played twice last week at Maples Pavilion, <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/stanford-extends-win-streak/\">beating</a> both No. 15 North Carolina and Duke in 3-0 victories. Against North Carolina, junior Jordyn Harvey hit .560 including 14 kills, six digs, four blocks and an ace, while senior Elia Rubin contributed another 12 kills, four digs and five blocks. Against Duke on Saturday, Rubin dominated some more with a career-high .609 with 23 errorless swings, 14 kills, eight digs and three blocks. After a third set ace, Rubin has officially become Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all-time career leader in aces. Coming up this week, Stanford will host No. 3 Pitt on Friday and No. 10 SMU on Sunday, both at Maples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sailing</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sailing was split between the ICSA Singlehanded Championship and West Coast Championship. Stanford came in third at both competitions. Junior Thomas Sitzmann scored 40 points, with five top-five finishes at the ICSA Singlehanded Championship. Next weekend Stanford will compete in the ICSA Match Race Championship and PCCSC Open Race Championship.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Football</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last weekend Stanford football <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/09/stanford-offense-roughed-up-in-loss/\">made the trip</a> to Chapel Hill, N.C. to play the University of North Carolina (UNC) in what turned out to be a 20-15 loss. The first half was slow and ended in a 3-3 tie, after Stanford knotted up the score with a field goal to end the half. The second half saw more scoring but not for Stanford. Throughout the next quarter and a half, UNC scored 17 unanswered points. By the time Stanford was able to find the endzone late in the fourth quarter the deficit had grown too large. The Cardinal enter a bye week as they use the long break to prepare for the 128th Big Game on Nov. 22.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women&#8217;s rowing</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Women&#8217;s rowing traveled to San Diego to compete in the San Diego Fall Classic last week. Of their nine boats, Stanford sent out four boats in the Open 8+ competition, where they swept the top four spots, and they sent out five boats in the Open 4+ competition where they again swept the top five. All nine of Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boats were unbeaten by teams from UCLA, University of San Diego, UC San Diego, San Diego State and UC Santa Barbara. Lightweight rowing sent out one lightweight team in the 8-person division and took seventh place, despite being the only lightweight team in attendance. In the four-person division, Stanford sent out two lightweight teams, taking sixth and 12th place respectively. The rowing teams will return in the spring for more action.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/cardinal-roundup-womens-soccer-ncaa/\">Cardinal roundup: Women&#8217;s soccer secures top seed in NCAA tourney</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/cardinal-roundup-womens-soccer-ncaa/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279720</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Rice discusses restoring confidence in American democracy in &#8216;Reimagining Democracy&#8217; speaker series</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/rice-discusses-in-american-democracy/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/rice-discusses-in-american-democracy/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Grace Pratt]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 08:14:54 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[American]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[civil]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Condoleezza Rice]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[democracy]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[democratic institutes]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Larry Diamond]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279701</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>In the final installment of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReimagining Democracy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d speaker series, Condoleezza Rice examined the sources of distrust in American democracy and discussed how to restore faith in these institutions. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/12/rice-discusses-in-american-democracy/\">Rice discusses restoring confidence in American democracy in &#8216;Reimagining Democracy&#8217; speaker series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>Stanford Continuing Studies, a program that shares educational resources with adult students, <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/08/reimagining-democracy-launches-for-its-second-year/\">hosted</a> the sixth and final installment of its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReimagining Democracy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d speaker series on Nov. 11. Coinciding with Veterans Day, the virtual webinar brought in Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, director of the Hoover Institution and Senior Fellow on Public Policy, to discuss restoring faith in American institutions.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>She was introduced by hosts Larry Diamond, Mosbacher Senior Fellow in Global Democracy at the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) for International Studies, and Karina Kloos, executive director of ePluribus Stanford. The two moderated the discussion, asking Rice about how citizens and leaders can help reinstate public confidence in democracy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before proposing how to reduce the stresses on democracy, Rice addressed the roots of declining trust in American institutions, citing waning confidence in electoral systems, civic structures, universities and even the military. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;There is an across the board sense that Americans don&#8217;t think their institutions are trustworthy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rice argued that this dissatisfaction stems from the belief that these institutions are not living up to constituents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expectations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen people elect their officials, they expect them to perform and be able to solve their problems,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[People pursue] circumstances in which they can build a fulfilling life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which can lead to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca disappointment in the capacity of democracy to deliver.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>She pointed to Congress as an institution in need of reform, suggesting term limits could bring \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfresh blood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and new perspectives to the House and Senate, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/analysis-why-are-there-so-many-more-older-lawmakers-than-young-ones-in-congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">where</a> roughly 20% of members are 70 or older. Diamond agreed, suggesting that the older age of many representatives might be hindering fresh ideas and adaptation to modern issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the framers imagined you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have members of Congress living into their eighties and nineties and still serving in Congress,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rice also emphasized the role of civil education in strengthening faith in democratic institutions. She called for a larger focus on educational equity, not only in higher education but also in K-12 schools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe real force of mobilization, which is a high-quality education, is becoming class-based,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, which leads to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitics of resentment rather than a sense of opportunity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In reforming education, Rice feels that there is an opportunity to promote public service. She urged the audience to find ways to serve, whether through the military, organizations like Teach for America or engaging with local government through campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than anything, though, Rice stressed the importance of being open-minded and willing to learn from different opinions. She highlighted two key practices for doing so: listening and civility. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLearning to listen to other people is important. You have to be open to changing your mind.

The panel, which later included three current students joining the panel on stage, started with a discussion of Stanford leadership under the current administration, which Steyer characterized as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe era of misinformation.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>University leadership faces \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple concerns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under this era, including providing resources for students of all backgrounds and advocating for universities collectively, Levin said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat makes university research different from company is the freedom here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it is this freedom that will make universities thrive for decades.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rice argued that universities should serve as marketplaces for ideas. She championed Stanford and other elite research universities as the innovation engine of the U.S.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Levin aded that while Stanford is out-GPUed by some of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley, the University will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwin by people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;The University does not have a private business model\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 We let people bounce into each other,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Moving into the broader political climate, Steyer asked about the dual pressures on universities, touching on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cColumbia situation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 referring to threads on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/columbia-agrees-pay-200-million-restore-funding-cut-trump-administrati-rcna220697\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funding</a> and free speech \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as the Trump administration&#8217;s pressure on affirmative action, which forced some universities to turn over sensitive student admission data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don&#8217;t answer to hypothetical questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rice said. When asked about what Stanford would do if targeted the same way Columbia and others have been, she said she \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t judge on all these different circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x9d </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>She added that she was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappalled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the general lack of understanding of the Middle East on college campuses. She noted she had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworked hard in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the region, flying there 24 times during her time as Secretary of State.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rice and Levin also emphasized the importance of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother aspects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of diversity. Levin noted that the University has prioritized \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiversity of opportunities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with domestic students in the bottom 80% of the U.S. income distribution <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/04/president-levins-remarks-on-expanding-the-undergraduate-class\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">paying</a> zero tuition and 90% of students <a href=\"https://admit.stanford.edu/finaid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">graduating </a>with no student loans.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of what has been defined as diversity\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 is actually exclusion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rice said, pointing to her upbringing in a highly educated Black family compared to the upbringing of an Appalachian child. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould I feel uncomfortable on a college campus [as an African American]? It is not just about race.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Student representatives including Daily Opinions managing editor Jennifer Levine \\xe2\\x80\\x9928, Joe Nail MBA \\xe2\\x80\\x9926 and Mandla Msipa \\xe2\\x80\\x9926 joined the panel to discuss the political atmosphere on campus.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Msipa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who is a dual citizen of Zimbabwe and the U.S. as well as a Residential Assistant (RA) at Hammarskj\\xc3\\xb6ld House, the international student themed dorm \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also asked the president what he is doing to protect international students in a climate where many say they do not feel protected.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Levin said that while the University would engage in other actions to ensure the rights of international students, such as lawsuits, it would remain in full compliance with federal laws regarding immigration. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no way that this country would be the leading country of the world if it does not welcome immigrants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Drawing from her experience as an editor, Levine argued for the importance of encouraging the exchange of different opinions on campus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStudent conversation is important\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Their opinions should be [ready to be] challenged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Msipa shared that he was grateful to see active political participation from students, pointing to the ability for pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli tents to sit across from one another for most of the 2023-24 school year &#8220;without throwing a punch.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just wanted to ask [the protesters], from which river to which sea?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rice responded, stressing the importance of students \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing informed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on what they are protesting.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nail said that a campus monoculture stops students from expressing their own opinions. The current ratio between conservative students and liberal students on campus is <a href=\"https://rankings.thefire.org/campus/243744-stanford-university?demo=all&amp;year=2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5.33 to 1</a>, he said.

Former Secretary of State and director of the Hoover Institution Condoleezza Rice delivered the keynote address.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday is about recognizing the service, sacrifice and continued contributions of the veterans in our community,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Zach Wright M.A. \\xe2\\x80\\x9927, a former staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Stanford Mendicants began the event with an a cappella performance of the national anthem. Other speakers at the event included vice provost Michele Rasmussen, Palo Alto Mayor Ed Lauing, Commander of American Legion Post 375 Ray Powell and Donna Zolezzi, president of South Bay Blue Star Moms, a military family support organization.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to Rasmussen, Stanford has 36 undergraduate student veterans and more than 100 graduate student veterans.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are grateful for their courage, their strength, for their valor and for answering the call to serve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rasmussen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us long remember the liberties we enjoy because they stepped up. Your service has made our world safer and our lives richer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Also in attendance at the event was Vietnam War veteran Sergeant Manny Velasco of the U.S. Marine Corps. Representatives from the South Bay Blue Star Moms <a href=\"https://www.southbaybluestarmoms.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">honored</a> Velasco with a Quilt of Valor, made by executive board member Denise Dobrenz.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Velasco called the gesture a symbol of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremembrance, care and gratitude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a reminder that we are seen and remembered and we are still part of something bigger than ourselves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Zolezzi, who was a teenager during the Vietnam War, recalled how many of the men in her senior class were drafted through a lottery. She remembered how her classmates <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/anti-war-protests-of-the-1960s-70s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned</a> to protests and anti-war gatherings.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a very favorable war. They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t treated very well when they came back home, and many of them didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come back home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Zolezzi said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe try to honor them, welcome them home and thank them for their service because they deserve that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It was this act of volunteering and sacrifice that Rice praised in her own speech. She also called for people to reflect on the progress the U.S. has made since its founding. Rice, who grew up in the segregated South, remembered the gravity of the moment when she was sworn in as Secretary of State, in the Franklin Room named for Benjamin Franklin.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is this black woman, child of the segregated South, taking an oath of office to defend the Constitution of America, which once counted her ancestors as three-fifths of a man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat&#8217;s the American collective story: progress together. Progress through our institutions. Progress because we keep an eye not just on who we were and who we are, but who we want to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" src=\"https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg?w=800\" alt=\"Stanford and City of Palo Alto hold Veterans Day celebration, recognize Vietnam War veteran\" class=\"wp-image-1279690\" title=\"Stanford and City of Palo Alto hold Veterans Day celebration, recognize Vietnam War veteran 4\" srcset=\"https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg 1600w, https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg?resize=600,450 600w, https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_4449a2.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn&#8217;t matter where you came from, it matters where you are going,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rice said in her keynote speech (Photo: ALANA BELLE M.

Consistent with the name, swimmers competed across three distances in one of six disciplines (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, sprint freestyle, distance freestyle and individual medley (IM) events). Stanford women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swimming beat Berkeley 192.5-131.5, while the men fell to the Golden Bears 158-180.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Swimming events from longest distance to shortest, those competing in the butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and sprint freestyle events swam the 200-, 100- and 50-yard distances of their discipline. Athletes swimming distance freestyle swam the 1000-, 500- and 200-yard freestyles, and swimmers in the IM discipline swam distances of 400, 200 and 100 yards.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Olympian and redshirt-senior Torri Huske was the sole Cardinal to grab wins in all three of her events, claiming 27 individual points for Stanford in the IM events. Huske touched first in the 100 (52.64), 200 (1:55.13), and 400 (4:04.21) distances, beating Berkeley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mia West by less than a second in each race.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Continuing their streak of breaststroke dominance throughout the season, junior Lucy Thomas and senior Lucy Bell split wins in their series. Thomas, Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary breaststroker in the 200 medley relay, took home first in the 50 breaststroke in a time of 26.91. Earlier this year, Bell notched herself as the second-fastest 100 breaststroker in Stanford history with a time of 58.29. This week, she continued to chip at her lifetime best, swimming a 58.27. In the 200 breaststroke, Bell won handily in a 2:04.76, over four and a half seconds ahead of second-place Thomas.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Also combining for wins in their series were sophomore Levenia Sim and junior Caroline Bricker in the women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s backstroke, and junior Jonathan Tan and senior Andres Dupont in the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sprint freestyle. Sim took home wins in the 50 and 100 backstrokes, swimming 24.61 and 52.67 to win her respective events. She also placed second to Bricker in the 200 distance, swimming a 1:55.57 to Bricker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s event winning time of 1:54.50.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Consistent with most high-level sprint events, the 50 and 100 freestyles came down to hundredths of seconds. Tan won the 50 freestyle for the Cardinal, swimming a 19.45 to out-touch fellow junior Ethan Harrington by 0.07 seconds. Dupont, in the closest finish of the day, finished first in a 42.78, beating Cal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nans Mazellier by a margin of 0.01 seconds. Dupont also reached the wall first in the 200 freestyle (1:34.57), rounding out the sprint freestyle sweep for the Cardinal men.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sophomores Bailey O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Regan (distance freestyle) and Finn Harland (backstroke) both picked up two out of three wins in their disciplines. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Regan, in a head-to-head distance duel against Cal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ava Chavez, won the 1000 (9:49.73) and 500 freestyles (4:48.44), touching first in the former by over 30 seconds. Harland took home wins in the shorter backstroke events for the Cardinal men, winning the 50 in 21.92 and the 100 in 46.97.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Senior Liam Custer and junior Gibson Holmes picked up wins in the 400 and 200 IM events, respectively. Custer, in a convincing, three-second win over Cal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Caspar Puggaard, touched first in a time of 3:46.06. Later on in the day, Holmes cruised to a first place finish in the 200 IM (1:45.70), beating Custer by two seconds. The senior was also the Cardinal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top finisher in the 100 IM (50.67) following a disqualification from Holmes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rounding out the wins for the Cardinal on the day were senior Gigi Johnson and junior Henry McFadden. Johnson, swimming the sprint freestyles, was Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top finisher in each of the three events, finishing second in the shorter pair and grabbing the win in the 200 freestyle (1:44.35) over Cal Olympian Mary-Ambre Moluh. McFadden, swimming butterfly, placed fourth in the 50 butterfly (21.88), second in the 100 (47.25), and won the 200 distance in a 1:43.10, over two and a half seconds faster than second.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Also finishing highest for Stanford were freshmen Ella Jablonski (3rd, 50/100 butterfly), Ella Detter (2nd, 200 butterfly), sophomore Daniel Li (2nd, 200 breaststroke), junior Henry Morrissey (3rd, 200/500 freestyle, 2nd, 100 freestyle) and senior Zhier Fan (3rd, 50 breaststroke, 2nd, 100 breaststroke).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Cardinal wrapped the meet in two mixed-gender relays, with both A-teams falling short to Cal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s A-relays. In the 200-yard mixed medley relay, Harrington (backstroke, 21.34), Fan (breaststroke, 23.75), Johnson (butterfly, 22.91) and Thomas (freestyle, 21.66) finished second in a combined time of 1:29.66. The 200-yard mixed freestyle relay, consisting of Dupont (19.87), McFadden (19.39), freshman Olasewere (21.88) and senior Kayla Wilson (22.56), also placed second in a time of 1:23.70.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Cardinal divers will compete this weekend at the Texas Diving Invite (Nov. 13-15). The women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team will return to the pool for the Texas Swimming Invite (Nov. 19-22) and the men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team will appear next in Dallas for the SMU Invite (Nov. 19-22).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For complete results from the Triple Distance meet, check <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/stanford-women-torri-huske-sweeps-im-races/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/stanford-splits-wins-in-meet-with-cal/\">Stanford swimming splits wins in Triple Distance meet against Cal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/stanford-splits-wins-in-meet-with-cal/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279665</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Week 10: Stanford in the NFL</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/week-10-stanford-in-the-nfl/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/week-10-stanford-in-the-nfl/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Joanne dePierre]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 06:08:10 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Football]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Fall Sports]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[alumni]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Cardinal]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[CMC]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Colby Parksinson]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Dalton Schultz]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[davis mills]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[McCaffrey]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[NFL]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford football]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279658</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Week 10 in the NFL saw clutch performances from former Cardinal on both sides of the ball, including a massive fourth-quarter comeback led by Texans\\' quarterback Davis Mills.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/week-10-stanford-in-the-nfl/\">Week 10: Stanford in the NFL</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>Week 10 was one of the more eventful weeks for former Cardinal across the league \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not necessarily with massive stat explosions, but with several clutch performances.

You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lounging in some black leather chair with a rip on one arm, dress shirt (and maybe a suit, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really into it) untucked. Just enough to still look presentable for the Big Guns. The croissant you nabbed from the office kitchens lies, two bites in, on a folded napkin. Steam rises lazily from your chipped coffee mug.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You check your watch: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seven past ten<em>.</em> You frown. No one is late to a meeting with <em>you</em>, you with your Stanford-educated background that has allowed you to rise so quickly up the ranks of Google, or McKinsey or whatever corporation whose ivory tower you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ascended.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just as you stand up to leave, the subject of your meeting bursts in. He is disheveled, hair uncombed, wafting in with a touch of mint toothpaste he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite rinse out this morning. He is lugging bags and bags of artifacts you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen in your life. He wears a strange and unknown garment, splattered with splots of bright and blotchy colors. You rule an empire, with all of the wealth and prestige and authority that such a title entails. He is nothing but a messenger, an emissary, a tour guide through your kingdom of riches. And then the man starts speaking.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You stare. Sit down. Endlessly. Entranced.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And so you may begin to understand how Kublai Khan felt in the opening pages of Italo Calvino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvisible Cities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Khan has tasked the wandering merchant Marco Polo with chronicling all the cities within his vast empire.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And chronicle Polo does, painting images of a myriad of fantastical worlds and uncanny metropoles to the aging Khan. There is Euphemia, where weary merchants stoop to trade away memories beneath the eyes of the equinox and solstice alike. Anastasia, where the infinity of desire enslaves you to the frenzied creation of pleasure. Hypatia, where ships dock at the pinnacles of citadels, where graveyards house the best music.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Halfway through the novel, however, we learn, as the Khan does, that Polo isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually describing various cities across the Khan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s empire, but rather Venice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over, and over and over again. Each new city is a retelling of Venice, and all of the grudges, corners, street vendors and love affairs it houses.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is the central tension of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvisible Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: How can the Khan, or us as an audience, for that matter, ever hope to understand Euphemia or Anastasia or Hypatia, or the cities Polo speaks of? And what of Venice? Even Polo, the chronicler, seems to have his doubts about the latter.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Polo says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the novel progresses, Polo and the Khan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversations grow increasingly abstract. Do they sit together sipping tea, or are they still immersed in the bazaars and bloody battlefields, brought together only in the lake of the mind? Do the cities that Polo describes even exist, or can he only ever experience them as an extension of Venice? The Khan attempts to capture each city as trinkets on a chessboard, only to realize that at the deepest levels of abstraction; there is once more nothing left but wood and the color of the squares.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the beating hearts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvisible Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<em> </em>is the treatise it drafts between the mind and the world. Kublai Khan, in his genuine desire to do real good, despairs at the notion of the infernal city.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Khan has, as Calvino puts it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[arrived at the] desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy, sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Khan, in his inability to separate this reality of empire from his ideal one, is constantly searching for mental metaphor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether that be as chess pieces, Polo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stories or his own dreams about an unburdened, unbloated city.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Polo, however, reminds us that the purpose of the mind isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to change reality; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to discern it. The &#8220;inferno of the living,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as he calls it, is more than the Khan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abstract fear; it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot something that will be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat is already here\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 where we live every day, that we form by being together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The power of the mind, then, lies in the ability to distinguish inferno from that which is not. To truly discern<em> </em>what is Euphemia, or Anastasia, or Hypatia or what is Venice. This is what the mind offers us on a basic level. Perhaps more curiously: To find the newborn quince tree and liberate it from the rotting carcasses of its elders, to wander through the fields of desires and fears that compose a city, to find a pattern subtle enough to escape an empire destined to crumble. That<em> </em>is the power of the mind.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since its publication in 1972, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvisible Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d<em> </em>has become revered as a staple of postmodern literature. But more just standing as a masterpiece of a specific literary era, Calvino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s novel might be <em>the</em> masterpiece. Recall that when Polo spoke of the various cities, he was speaking of Venice, over and over and over again. On a very metacognitive level, the book itself is an inversion of that idea: When one speaks of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvisible Cities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they speak of memory. Of death. Of time and permanence and power and culture.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over and over and over again.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/and-so-we-thought-there-is-a-universe-of-ideas-in-invisible-cities/\">And So We Thought: There is a universe of ideas in \\xe2\\x80\\x98Invisible Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/and-so-we-thought-there-is-a-universe-of-ideas-in-invisible-cities/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279681</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>From the Community &#124; How Club Sports&#8217; new funding policy hurts women</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/from-the-community-how-club-sports-new-funding-policy-hurts-women/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/from-the-community-how-club-sports-new-funding-policy-hurts-women/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[From the Community]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 21:29:53 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[From the Community]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Opinions]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[club sports]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[equitable]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[golf]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[SPORTS]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[women]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279641</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Club Golf financial officer Araha Uday \\'26 argues that the new Club Sports funding policies hurt women more than they help. </p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/from-the-community-how-club-sports-new-funding-policy-hurts-women/\">From the Community | How Club Sports&#8217; new funding policy hurts women</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the financial officer of Club Golf, one of the co-ed club sports at Stanford. As a woman, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m deeply concerned that Club Sports\\xe2\\x80\\x99 new <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/14/club-sports-react-to-funding-travel/\">financial policies</a> for co-ed teams, which they claim will benefit women, will actually harm them.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since COVID, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve focused on rebuilding. Between 2023 and 2024, we <a href=\"https://nccga.org/app/golf-tournaments/team-rankings/178-fall-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased</a> our national ranking from 102nd to 43th place through hard work and inclusive recruitment. Our membership has also doubled because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve promoted our organization through equal-access venues like campus club fairs and social media. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t track gender demographics because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more focused on competing and improving the team as a whole. Still, two-thirds of our executive board are women, and one of our founders was a woman. Our female competitors are at the top of our club and easily qualify for tournaments. And from what I hear, our female members feel included and represented thanks to continuous efforts to expand across communities.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, the progress we have made towards inclusivity is now at risk.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until recently, receiving funding for Club Golf was straightforward. Every spring, each club team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial officer submitted a budget to Club Sports, which then applied for one large grant from the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU). In the fall, Club Sports distributed ASSU funds to its constituent teams in one-time deposits. Teams were responsible for managing their funds throughout the year to cover the costs of&nbsp;uniforms, tournaments and more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year, however, that process was overhauled. Now, every individual expense must be pre-approved by Club Sports on their timeline. While that creates more paperwork, we initially thought it could be a positive change since it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cap funding for additional tournaments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Then came the catch: Club Sports and the Stanford administration has now decreed that every co-ed team must aim for over 51% female representation on its competitive roster to meet Title IX compliances. Any extra male members must self-fund their expenses. To illustrate: if our competitive team has eight members \\xe2\\x80\\x94 three women and five men \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Club Sports will only pay for the three women and three men. The remaining two men must pay out of pocket.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a conversation with Club Sports, our co-president urged them to recognize a simple truth: golf, throughout its centuries-long history, has never seen women overrepresented. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.ngf.org/short-game/golf-participation-growing-diversifying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according</a> to the National Golf Foundation, 28% of golfers in the U.S. were women as of 2024, a record high. Our co-president explained that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense for our student-run club to be penalized for that broader gender pattern. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Club Sports claims the changes are in the interest of women, but heading into my third year as financial officer, I never felt that Club Sports particularly cared about my experience as a female club sport leader. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more likely their motivations relate to budget pressure rather than Title IX. That would especially make sense considering that Club Sports also just removed <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/14/club-sports-react-to-funding-travel/\">funding for travel</a> as well as for financial aid on dues. Since University-wide funding availability has been <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/06/update-2025-2026-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cut</a> due to new federal policies, this new policy is disguised as a motion towards gender equality. There are a few reasons why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s damaging to everyone, especially female athletes.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>First, it incentivizes gender segregation. The policy only applies to co-ed sports, which means a club could split into separate men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teams to avoid funding losses for male players \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that would destroy the policy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose. And unfortunately, a competitive women&#8217;s golf club would face difficulty establishing itself due to limited female participation and in turn reduced funding eligibility. A men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team, on the other hand, would thrive, as there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no shortage of male athletes interested in golf.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a woman, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be excluded from the sport I love. And as a financial officer, I&nbsp;know a co-ed club team is good for financial and administrative efficiency. Yet, after cutting co-ed funding, Club Sports informed us that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompliance and proportionality is something [they] want teams to start striving for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This new policy could push organizations to regress into what the policy claims to fight: male-dominated communities.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, it advantages donor-backed teams and pressures unreasonable funding routes. Because the policy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forbid majority-male teams, co-ed teams with external donor support can easily sidestep these rules by paying for the additional male players, while smaller, student-funded teams (like ours) cannot. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just unfair.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Additionally, our club keeps dues low to welcome non-competitive members from all backgrounds and skill levels. That accessibility has helped attract new female participants. But Club Sports suggested that we rely on unrestricted dues \\xe2\\x80\\x94 collected from non-competitive members for recreational programming \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to fund tournaments for the competitive team. Alternatively, they would have us unfairly ask a few male players to pay an additional hundreds of dollars. Inevitably, the costs will be shared by all members, including the women the policy claims to benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Third, the implementation was opaque.<strong> </strong>Our team wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t informed of the changes until days before our first tournament. If Club Sports cared about inclusivity, they would have collaborated with the female leaders of co-ed teams. They also would have communicated future adjustments and encouraged teams to start moving toward them, rather than imposing immediate penalties that left us no time to plan.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For Club Golf, the prioritization of quotas over performance could undo years of progress by our leadership. I imagine that my team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s female athletes are not the only ones who are deeply frustrated, especially since the policy intends to create fairness and equality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If Club Sports genuinely wanted to promote gender equity, they should focus on the overall distribution of funding across sports rather than punishing individual co-ed teams. For example, creating and funding more programs that already interest women would facilitate equal distribution of resources.

Having been unexpectedly whisked off at 5 p.m. the previous day (lured in by free tickets), I entered the world of social dance, dizzy and giddy. The hours magically whizzed by. This was my last dance before leaving, and here I was in the Latin room, doing the salsa. Then, with the last note, I was dipped, all the way to the floor.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That is when I fell in love.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recounted this experience to my starry-eyed frosh hallmates immediately upon returning. My <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=OO0puW8AEps&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fusc-powerpoint.officeapps.live.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">La La Land</a>-loving friends were convinced that <em>this dip</em> was a sign, irrevocably, that this lead was smitten with me. For all of us, it was a scene straight from a movie. And who can blame us? I did fall in love that night \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but amid the dizzying spins, I had misplaced my attraction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many have uttered that love is a dance. I say, social dance is a love.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After taking my first social dance class, I quickly realized that the salsa dancer was not my personal Prince Charming; he was merely a fantastic lead. He <em>did</em> make me feel like I knew what I was doing; he <em>was</em> very playful; he <em>did</em> make the night magical. My friends weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wrong to conflate it as romance, especially when related through my rose-tinted storytelling. All these characteristics are components of flirting \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but also critical to being a fantastic lead. Little did I understand, <a href=\"https://www.richardpowers.com/partnering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good partnering</a> in dance is like good flirting:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\\n<li>You listen to your partner deeply, noting details, call &amp; response. They go, I go \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It is a good conversation, dynamically flowing.</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>You let loose \\xe2\\x80\\x94 have a good time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 act playful! Tension hinders enjoyment \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 expressing individuality and creativity engages your partner!</li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<li>You are physically considerate and aware. You (attempt to) clearly express your intentions and then listen to see if your partner takes it another direction or declines! Psychologically, we link attraction with body language mirroring, eye contact, and open postures. Incidentally \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 all these are keys to good partnering.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now, there is also a cultural element at play here: the romanticization of dancing. Many Stanford students come to the social dance scene with this media-based understanding of dance as romance. Media, songs, and literature portray dancing as an inherently romantic activity, exclusively for couples or soon-to-be couples. There is no escaping the stretch of this narrative, as it ranges from Leo Tolstoy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Anna Karenina <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=RtFIzg1q6Og&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fusc-powerpoint.officeapps.live.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dancing</a> with Count Vronsky, to Dirty Dancing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Johnny <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpmILPAcRQo&amp;t=2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">teaching</a> Baby how to mambo. Some might argue, sure, that Penny, Johnny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life-long dance partner, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike a sister\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to him \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but that was not the movie\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focal story. We bought tickets for a romance \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to be swept off our feet and flown high. There simply are not many movies that emphasize social dancing as purely for sport, undramatized and de-romanced.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But of course we love love! Platonic love is rarely the story we want to be told. The audience is drawn to dance as a vessel for a happily-ever-after with our OneTrueLove<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />.&nbsp; As an art form rooted in partnership, permeated with both physical and eye contact, any engagement is presumed to be a narrative stepping stone to romantic coupling. Slow dancing equals love, right? This works in stories, but what happens once we return our novels to the shelves (or, rather, X out of our Netflix account)? Can we have the same shorthand logic about dance in real life?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we may surmise, this way of thinking can quickly turn problematic. On an academic level, we can analyze these dance-romances for their anthropological implications. Our cultural psyche has onion layers to peel back: our storybook fantasies of romance, our gender biases against inter-gender platonic intimacy, and our interpretation of art (a dance) as the artist (a dancer). But why else is fantastical romanticism concretely harmful? If students expect lovey-dovey passion with each Lindy-Hop or waltz, then they will be guaranteed disappointment. Much worse, they could engage in unwarranted and unwanted amorous <a href=\"https://www.richardpowers.com/sketchy-guys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advances</a>. This harms everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enjoyment of Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s social-dancing shindigs, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way to build community.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Luckily, we can change this culture around social dance by setting expectations for a completely platonic sport, guaranteeing the emotional safety of dancers everywhere. The <a href=\"https://dancebreak.stanford.edu/info/local/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">community</a> at Stanford and the greater Bay Area is one of the most advanced I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in terms of communication around gender equality, mutual appreciation between follows and leads, harassment, and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ folks. The rest of the world still exists, though, and the romantic media narrative ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going anywhere&nbsp;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as far as I can tell&nbsp;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 so we have a duty to educate newcomers to the community here, and an opportunity as we disperse the world over.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social dance is still an act of love. But rather than being <em>romantically</em> attracted to one another, partners collaborate on a love letter to dance itself, working together to guide the pencil across the page, tracing figures onto the floor. What works in flirting works in dancing, as these are universal methods of interacting confidently, considerately, and collaboratively. Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cut a rug and <a href=\"https://song.link/us/i/1469584193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">find</a> the happiness we seek!</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/dancing-cheek-to-cheek-the-romanticism-of-social-dance/\">Dancing cheek-to-cheek: The romanticism of social dance</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/11/dancing-cheek-to-cheek-the-romanticism-of-social-dance/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279613</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Liu &#124; Democracy Day needs a higher calling</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/liu-democracy-day-needs-a-higher-calling/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/liu-democracy-day-needs-a-higher-calling/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Liu]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:44:18 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Columnists]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Opinions]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[democracy]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[democracy day]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[political]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279616</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Liu argues that Stanford needs to engage politically during Democracy Day, and future programming needs to be more conducive to student activism.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/liu-democracy-day-needs-a-higher-calling/\">Liu | Democracy Day needs a higher calling</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>As President John F. Kennedy reminded us at his 1960 presidential inauguration, democracy has never been sustained by comfort.\\xc2\\xa0At the heart of every enduring democracy lies a single virtue: civic sacrifice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the willingness to give to your neighbor, the vulnerable and the public good. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last Tuesday, Stanford held its fifth annual <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/29/beyond-the-ballot-box-democracy-day-returns-for-fifth-consecutive-year/\">Democracy Day</a>, with events from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Arguments around turnout and campus culture aside, the event failed to live up to this virtue of civic sacrifice of putting others before ourselves. What should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a day to call on students to take up causes aligned with their values, to disconnect from their busy lives on campus and answer a higher calling of serving our community, became a day of self-gratification disconnected from this very mission.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A place like Stanford \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so often isolated from the rest of the Bay Area, let alone the country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can be isolating and consequently, many students feel as though anything they do here won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a difference. But as professor Adam Bonica highlights in his Democracy Day <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/04/from-the-community-stanfords-place-in-a-global-tradition-of-student-democratic-participation/\">op-ed</a> piece, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn nearly every democratic breakthrough of the past half century, the spark came not from parliaments or boardrooms, but from campus quads, lecture halls and late-night conversations among students who refused to accept the world as it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stanford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own history of student activism <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2015/02/11/stanfords-rich-history-of-divestment-movements/\">highlights</a> the indispensable role of students in these democratic breakthroughs. Therefore, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d expect Democracy Day to be a continuation of this storied democratic tradition: Students taking action for the society, causes and institutions that we all care for.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Moreover, at a time when ICE agents are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/us/immigration-raid-los-angeles-toddler.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">separating</a> parents from their children and half a million Bay Area residents are <a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/snap-shutdown-fears-nearly-half-million-san-francisco-bay-area-residents-rely-calfresh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starving</a> due to the SNAP cuts, Democracy Day should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a call to action. But when I attended the day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s events as a panelist and participant this year, I was shocked to see how disconnected it was from this spirit of action. I kept asking myself, how does a button-making station or narrative workshop speak to the larger issues facing our democracy? Even my own panel, which was on the incredibly important subject of the <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/05/first-amendment-panelists-free-speech/\">First Amendment</a>, lacked a call to action. Instead of talking about the First Amendment, I thought, shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we mobilize to protect the First Amendment rights of international students, who are losing their legal status because of their involvement in peaceful protests and publications? In fact, of the 32 events on the Democracy Day <a href=\"https://www.democracydaystanford.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calendar</a>, there was only one service activity: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAssembling Early Literacy Bundles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The overwhelming majority of the events were panels (10) , workshops (11) and dialogues (8). If Democracy Day is about impact, shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the events center on service rather than speeches and participation over panels?\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Democracy Day deserves not cancellation or defunding, but transformation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one that directs its energy outwards towards a diverse and complicated country, rather than inwards toward an increasingly insular campus community. In other words, for Democracy Day to succeed, we have to get off campus. Concretely, rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars on free t-shirts, food vendors and guest speakers, we ought to use Democracy Day funding to take students to community service initiatives around the Bay and California, or bring those service opportunities to campus. These activities may include volunteering at a food bank (many of which are currently overwhelmed with SNAP dependees) or joining an immigrant advocacy group to inform immigrants of their rights and teach them about American civics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But there are those who say that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking too much of students. If students aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already going to panels with celebrity speakers and free food and drink, why would they spend the day serving the hungry or helping immigrants navigate the legal system? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fair question \\xe2\\x80\\x94 full-time students already have enough on their plate. But democracy has never been sustained by comfort. It demands more of us, as Kennedy reminded us a generation ago: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for a country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Long before him, another American President, Theodore Roosevelt, inspired that same spirit in journalist William Allen White, who later wrote that Roosevelt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoured into my heart such vision, such ideals, such hopes, such a new attitude toward life and patriotism and the meaning of things, as I had never dreamed men had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As the next generation of leaders, we must carry that energy and idealism forward into the next chapter of our American experiment. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And to parrot the words of President Kennedy once more, we serve our democracy not because it&#8217;s easy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or for the free food and Democracy Day t-shirts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/liu-democracy-day-needs-a-higher-calling/\">Liu | Democracy Day needs a higher calling</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/liu-democracy-day-needs-a-higher-calling/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279616</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Students to carry American flag from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, honoring veterans</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/students-to-carry-american-flag-from-death-valley-to-mount-whitney-honoring-veterans/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/students-to-carry-american-flag-from-death-valley-to-mount-whitney-honoring-veterans/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Geoffrey Franc]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:26:01 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Campus Life]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[america club]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[flag]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[flags]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[journey]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[military]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[military affiliated students]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[veteran]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[veterans day]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279604</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>To honor servicemembers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sacrifices, a group of Stanford students will carry Old Glory on foot and bicycle from Death Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney on Veterans Day.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/students-to-carry-american-flag-from-death-valley-to-mount-whitney-honoring-veterans/\">Students to carry American flag from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, honoring veterans</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>While Veterans Day comes and goes for many, a band of Stanford students and recent graduates are going the extra mile to commemorate it. Or rather, the extra 145 miles: they will spend the day carrying the American flag from the lowest point to the highest point in the lower 48 states in one day.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Co-organizer Joe Nail M.A. \\xe2\\x80\\x9926 M.B.A. \\xe2\\x80\\x9927, created the challenge to honor the sacrifices of American servicemembers and raise awareness for Team Red, White &amp; Blue Inc., a veterans organization which <a href=\"https://teamrwb.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotes</a> veteran fitness and facilitates the transition to civilian life.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the clock strikes midnight on Nov. 11, Nail, Alex Romano M.S. \\xe2\\x80\\x9925 and co-organizer Adrien Richez M.S. \\xe2\\x80\\x9926, along with five other students, a cinematographer, a support car and Old Glory, will set out from the lowest point in North America \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Badwater Basin in Death Valley, Calif., at 282 feet below sea level. The team will then head northwest towards Lone Pine, first running the flag, switching out runners every mile.\\xc2\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After climbing the ridge which marks the western border of Death Valley National Park, Richez will mount himself, the Star-Spangled Banner and the POW-MIA flag onto a bike for the descent into Lone Pine, at the base of Mount Whitney. From Lone Pine, the trek is entirely on foot, and Nail expects to arrive with the American flag at the 14,505-foot summit no earlier than 8:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That is, if everything goes to plan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHopefully we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t die from an avalanche,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Romano said, laughing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He was only partly joking: just two weeks ago, a hiker <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-27/hiker-death-mt-whitney-winter-winter-snow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">died</a> after falling from a snow-covered switchback some 2,000 feet below the summit, and in January, another hiker <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/mount-whitney-hiker-missing-nearly-week-20014154.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">died</a> in bad weather. And with the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598315/government-shutdown-longest-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ongoing</a> federal government shutdown, Nail said, the team can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rely on ranger support if something goes wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, the team has taken many measures to abate risk. For one thing, among the five people planning to summit, three have vast mountaineering experience. Nail himself has summited Mount Whitney nine times and was deployed to an Army mountain infantry unit based in Colorado.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All have prepared extensively for the trip. Aside from being held to Department of War fitness standards as part of their own military service, Nail and others did part of the route in August to determine even higher fitness levels to be expected of participants. Richez spent 11 hours one day last week climbing the foothills around Stanford on his bike. Additionally, the team secured backing from adventure racing company Spartan Race to provide specialized gear needed for the ascent.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanning logistics was terrible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Romano said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe got, seven, eight people total, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covering the 145 miles, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covering different terrains too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Still, the organizers see these challenges as miniscule compared to the sacrifices of those they honor in uniform. In fact, most participants are Stanford-affiliated military servicemembers representing all branches except the Coast Guard, though they noted that their expressed views are not necessarily those of the Department of War. Nail, Romano and Richez all come from families in military service, and they looked to the sacrifices of their forefathers as inspiration to join the officer corps.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Romano and Richez matriculated into the U.S. Naval Academy straight out of high school and joined the Space Force and Navy, respectively. Nail graduated first in his class at the Army\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Officer Candidate School after graduating from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in political science and Duke with a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in divinity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the last two years, all three came to Stanford as Knight-Hennessy scholars. Nail, while noting that the Stanford community writ-large was grateful for and supportive of his military service, said he was unsettled by some early experiences on the Farm.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn my first day as a graduate student here at Stanford, the very first question that I got asked was how I could morally justify serving in the United States military,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nail said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He said his concern rose when, at the height of protests around the Israel-Hamas war, anti-American slogans <a href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/10/02/stanford-pro-palestine-protesters-indicted-on-felony-charges/\">appeared</a> in graffiti across Main Quad. In response, Nail, Romano and Andrew Fabela \\xe2\\x80\\x9926, founded America Club, a student organization with the goal of reviving patriotic spirit on campus.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Nail\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, part of that mission is building appreciation for those who serve in the military, especially veterans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do wish that there was a lot more of a focus by the university to recognize the people who have risked their lives to protect the freedoms that we enjoy and take for granted on campus,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nail said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Richez added that his own pride in America was shaped by the gratitude his immigrant parents had for the opportunities the U.S. provided. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny, you know, my parents are these naturalized American citizens that speak with horrific French accents, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just like the most patriotic people I know, and they love this country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud to be an American and serving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Aside from honoring the sacrifices of those in uniform, Richez and his co-organizers hope that the Veterans Day Challenge instills that same pride in public service to younger generations at Stanford and beyond. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just think a life without service to others is \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the point?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Richez said.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/students-to-carry-american-flag-from-death-valley-to-mount-whitney-honoring-veterans/\">Students to carry American flag from Death Valley to Mount Whitney, honoring veterans</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/students-to-carry-american-flag-from-death-valley-to-mount-whitney-honoring-veterans/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279604</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/global-health-opportunities-fair-helps-connect-students-to-organizations-in-light-of-recent-federal-funding-cuts/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/global-health-opportunities-fair-helps-connect-students-to-organizations-in-light-of-recent-federal-funding-cuts/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Anisha Pandey]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:13:19 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Science & Technology]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[global health]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Global Health Club]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Global Health Fair]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Opportunity fair]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Stanford]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://stanforddaily.com/?p=1279593</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The annual Global Health Opportunities Fair hosted on Friday night featured over thirty different opportunities and more than one hundred student attendees.</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/global-health-opportunities-fair-helps-connect-students-to-organizations-in-light-of-recent-federal-funding-cuts/\">Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[\\n<p>On Friday evening, over 100 students and local organizations gathered for the annual Global Health Opportunities Fair at the Li Ka Shing Learning and Knowledge Center.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Stanford Undergraduate Global Health Club (UGHC) and Stanford Graduate Global Health Network (GGHN) hosted the event in collaboration with the Center for Innovation in Global Health (CIGH) and Bay Area Global Health Alliance (BAGHA). The organizers of the fair aimed to provide a unique space to connect students with organizations that need more support.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With recent challenges to U.S global health priorities such as the shutdown of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and stifling of the United States President&#8217;s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of uncertainty and fear about what the next step is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hailey Ramzan \\xe2\\x80\\x9927, UGHC vice president.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of global health nonprofits, especially those on the smaller to medium-size scale, had to lay off many people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Max Zhang Yang \\xe2\\x80\\x9927, UGHC president and one of the co-organizers of the fair. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt the same time, we heard from students that they wanted to get more involved in research and were fine with volunteering their time, even if it was unpaid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Simply bringing people with common interests together can help kickstart such efforts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[The fair] can facilitate an exchange of ideas, you can learn about what other global health work that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on, maybe research methodologies you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never heard about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yang said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yang co-organized the event with Eliza Ennis, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in health policy, who is also a leader of the GGHN and a BAGHA Advisory Council Member.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ennis was hoping to support students by connecting them with global health organizations across the Bay. When she first came to Stanford, she was aware of ongoing global health research but unsure of how to find it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know as a grad student, I have projects that I would love to have an undergrad help with,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ennis said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The event was able to feature more than thirty opportunities including on-campus labs and international non-profits with support from BAGHA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections with non-Stanford organizations, according to organizers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Michele Barry, Director of CIGH and Colin Boyle, Board Chair of BAGHA provided opening remarks. Students were then encouraged to walk around the room and introduce themselves to representatives tabling around the room.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yang hopes the fair can be a stepping stone for newer students to get involved with the community lifelong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe key is to think globally and act locally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yang said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEspecially as undergrads, there tend to be more local opportunities but being able to address health inequities anywhere is really crucial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ennis, originally from rural New Mexico, agreed that there shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a big differentiation between global and local health. She sees plenty of benefits of applying the same techniques and lessons learned in domestic rural settings to places abroad.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The fair also attracted students and organizations with more non-traditional backgrounds in global health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kushal Patel \\xe2\\x80\\x9929 attended the event to find a mentor that shares his interdisciplinary interests across technology and health policy. He described global health as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot an industry, but a culture of social innovation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Adeline Liao \\xe2\\x80\\x9927 was recruiting students to join her startup Niora Systems, which focuses on developing technology to prevent systemic failures in medication delivery.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Global health is not] just a space exclusively for non-profits, but systems that span economics and markets, private sector industries, and multinational collaborations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Liao said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>UGHC prides itself on being a diverse, wide-ranging club for people of all majors and pre-professional tracks, according to Yang. He believes this diversity in perspective offers students the opportunity to broaden their own horizons.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven though I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come from a health policy background, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been forced to confront the fact that this is an integral part of making global health a reality,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yang said.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ramzan thinks similar events can continue to promote awareness about a lack of accessibility in the wide varieties of healthcare systems around the globe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think global health is as much of a problem for us as it is for the people in rural Kenya,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ramzan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is our responsibility to leverage our position as Stanford students, or just anyone in the world with privilege, to uplift those who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/global-health-opportunities-fair-helps-connect-students-to-organizations-in-light-of-recent-federal-funding-cuts/\">Global Health Opportunities Fair helps connect students to organizations in light of recent federal funding cuts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stanforddaily.com\">The Stanford Daily</a>.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://stanforddaily.com/2025/11/10/global-health-opportunities-fair-helps-connect-students-to-organizations-in-light-of-recent-federal-funding-cuts/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">1279593</post-id>\\t</item>\\n\\t</channel>\\n</rss>\\n',\n",

Coclo reached an all-time high of 1,335 users this quarter and, as of November 10, has processed approximately 400 transactions since its release.</p>\\n<p>According to Blatt, Coclo is designed for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstereotypical ramen-eating, low-budget college student\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who wants a cheap, easy, and sustainable way to buy and sell secondhand clothes on campus.</p>\\n<p>Blatt said that students wanted a way to exchange clothes exclusively with others on campus to avoid the hassles and costs of shipping. She also pointed out that graduating students often wanted to get rid of clothes in their current wardrobe as they moved away and into more professional environments. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe interviewed nearly 100 UChicago students before even writing any code to figure out their frustrations with existing solutions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Vu said.</p>\\n<p>Alpaugh used her experience with other online reselling platforms to create an alternative to options like Facebook Marketplace and Depop designed specifically for the needs of UChicago students. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI bring to Coclo my years of selling secondhand online and in the Boston area,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alpaugh said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis pairs beautifully with Mai\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technical background and Samara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing genius.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re providing a service that is intended for clothing that should be used again and again and again and again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blatt said.</p>\\n<p>Because all exchanges on Coclo occur in person, students don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to deal with the costs, wait times, and environmental concerns of shipping. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShipping <a href=\"https://www.freightos.com/freight-resources/air-sea-freight-co2-emissions-calculator/\">is</a> one of the biggest CO2 producers and to take that away is a huge benefit, and I think [Coclo] really would appeal to people who value that sustainability aspect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blatt said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] also the convenience factor\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x98I need something last-minute, and I need it now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Since its launch, Blatt said that Coclo has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DP2aUkfkSRp/\">organized</a> in-person events in collaboration with MODA and the Phoenix Sustainability Initiative to grow its user base and further connect to the UChicago community. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I go to reach out to a specific organization about doing something, my initial thought is, is there an area or a community on campus that we have not intentionally served yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</p>\\n<p>First-year Hunter Green is a Coclo user who discovered the app through a clothing swap Coclo co-hosted with MODA. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found a bunch of neat thrifts\\xe2\\x80\\x94I just wish they hosted more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n<p>Coclo also won the UChicago Tech Showcase earlier this year. Since then, the app has received support from both <a href=\"https://ltf.vc/portfolio\">LTF Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://polsky.uchicago.edu/2025/07/31/8-students-receive-polsky-founders-fund-fellowships-to-work-on-their-ventures-full-time/\">Polsky Founder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fund Fellowship</a> for further development.</p>\\n<p>Although most of the app\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funding comes through scholarship and grant programs, Coclo also takes a small percentage from the seller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end of transactions, Blatt said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of the money, if we have any, is going back into the app,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</p>\\n<p>Coclo is also constantly responding to user feedback with frequent new updates, according to Vu. Recently, they implemented an AI listing feature that writes a description of students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 items based on a photo of the item and sorts items into categories.</p>\\n<figure id=\"attachment_49354\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49354\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-small wp-image-49354\" src=\"https://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coclo-2-300x199.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coclo-2-300x199.png 300w, https://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coclo-2-600x397.png 600w, https://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coclo-2-768x509.png 768w, https://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/coclo-2.png 841w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-49354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coclo has a CO2 emission-tracking feature.

Some experiences are conducted through pre-existing research programs in affiliation with the University, while others are formed by students as independent research projects. The <em>Maroon</em> interviewed six students who pursued international research last summer and asked them about their time abroad.</p>\\n<p>One of these independent projects belonged to Elijah Jenkins, who spent time in Palau and Guam studying local culture and embarking on local archaeological trips. Palau\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intimate culture as a result of its natural environment made the experience distinct for Jenkins. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on an island, and [there are] only 8,000 people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jenkins said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s isolating because there are no college students there, so I really just forced myself to meet people in the community and spend time with them through my research work, which is a lot different than being in Chicago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Fourth-year Paolo Andrade had a similar experience acclimating to his creative residency over the summer in Chiang Mai, Thailand. During the program, Andrade researched several ongoing issues in Southeast Asia, such as the long-standing conflict in Myanmar, in order to contribute to an art series on labor and immigration patterns in the Global South.</p>\\n<p>Because his project was inherently linked to the culture and location of his residency, Andrade argued, it was impossible to do from a campus office. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe objective of this screening series was to create an intercultural dialogue between South America and Southeast Asia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrade said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI talked to people from Myanmar, people from Thailand, and they have unique characteristics that are only there because of their lived experiences they have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Third-year Jacob Rothman participated in the German Academic Exchange Service Research Internships in Science and Engineering (DAAD RISE) program, a UChicago\\xe2\\x80\\x93associated summer research internship which matches students with research groups in universities based in Germany, where they assist doctoral students in their research projects. German culutre felt unfamiliar at first, but he eventually came to feel like he was at home. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was different enough to add a lot, but not different enough to make me uncomfortable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rothman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe longer the summer went on, the more it felt like I was just in a safer, cleaner America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Lekha Masoudi, a fourth-year history major and biology minor, traveled to Nain Gahar, a small village in northern India in the Western Himalayas, to study the Eurasian wren on an independent project. Masoudi had participated in DAAD RISE in a previous summer. She had enjoyed the research but felt more independent in her most recent experience. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot more restrictive to be in a lab. I was also working on a Ph.D. student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s project, and it was interesting, but it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something that I could design myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Masoudi said, referring to DAAD RISE.</p>\\n<p>Elsa Batalden, who traveled across four cities in Norway studying pre-trial detention practices \\xc2\\xa0and received a Summer International Travel Grant for her project, also felt a unique sense of freedom in her adventure. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to constantly check in with someone in a way that you do if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a lab on campus,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Batalden said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was able to really go where my interests took me and make the project my own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>To students like Jenkins, the independence that comes from being abroad makes their personal interest in the project stronger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince it was more of a passion project, it was cool to do it independently. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a self-discovery experience as well throughout the summer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jenkins said.</p>\\n<p>Claire Barbosa, a fourth-year public policy major who did research in Australia, felt that there were some unique advantages of doing on-campus research that cannot come from international research. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing abroad, I have been able to meet a lot more people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barbosa said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 being on campus gets you really close connections with faculty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>When asked what advice she would give students considering research, Masoudi said that building on past experiences is key to figuring out what you want to study. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe more work that I did in labs before, the more I was able to figure out what I was interested in for this and really narrow in on a project,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven if your first lab or first research you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is not your favorite thing, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll still help narrow down your interests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Jenkins echoed a similar sentiment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could figure out the topic based on your classes and discover it that way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken two other classes that helped me redefine what my research question was going to be, and so I would always focus on my final projects to be surrounding the topic I was thinking about doing. By the time I ended up saying I was going to do this in my thesis, I kind of already knew about it because every class I was taking was focusing on that subject matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Barbosa encouraged students to focus on their interests. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can have an adventure pretty much anywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce you like a certain subject, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take you to a location, and I think you could have a great time anywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://chicagomaroon.com/49349/news/international-research-gives-students-opportunities-for-independent-exploration/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Daily Minis &#8211; 54</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://chicagomaroon.com/49186/crosswords/daily-minis-54/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://chicagomaroon.com/49186/crosswords/daily-minis-54/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[By Piyush Garodia and Carter Otis]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 06:00:15 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Crosswords]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Minis]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://chicagomaroon.com/?p=49186</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\\n        <div style=\"position: relative;text-align: center\">\\n            <div class=\"pm-embed-div\" data-id=\"ebd06a72\" data-set=\"ffba3708904a8af6c7944a6874cb5c326d4d7f6fe90f7802bdb21c0e9a86a244\" data-puzzleType=\"crossword\" data-height=\"700px\" data-embedparams=\"embed=wp\"></div>\\n            <div class=\"pm-attribution-div\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 12px;color:#666666;padding-top: 5px;width: 100%\">Made by Chicago Maroon Crossword Team with the free &lt;a href=\"https://amuselabs.com/games/crossword/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #666666; text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;crossword creator&lt;/a&gt; from Amuse Labs</div>\\n        </div>\\n        </span></p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://chicagomaroon.com/49186/crosswords/daily-minis-54/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>As Obama Center Nears Completion, Local Residents and City Council Seek to Address Gentrification Concerns</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://chicagomaroon.com/49345/news/as-obama-center-nears-completion-local-residents-and-city-council-seek-to-address-gentrification-concerns/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://chicagomaroon.com/49345/news/as-obama-center-nears-completion-local-residents-and-city-council-seek-to-address-gentrification-concerns/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[By Julian Moreno]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 18:22:23 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[News]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Obama Center]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Woodlawn]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://chicagomaroon.com/?p=49345</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[As the Obama Presidential Center nears completion, nearby tenants and community advocates have raised fears it will further increase local housing costs.

The ordinance, passed by a roll-call vote on September 25, will reserve 25 public lots for affordable housing, provide up to $3 million worth of property tax relief, and give some tenants the opportunity to purchase their units.</p>\\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An initial draft of the ordinance was <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/124pr_-ifDMIQT8Vlx41p2RKVGEU4VCU07yXflEMbtPc/edit?tab=t.0\">introduced</a> in October 2023 and would have included the implementation of Chicago-wide tenant protections, fee caps, and deep affordability requirements.

After federal courts intervened, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/03/nx-s1-5596121/snap-food-benefits-trump-government-shutdown\">authorized</a> states to issue half the usual benefits using money from a USDA contingency fund.</p>\\n<p>Since then, food pantries on the South Side have faced increased traffic to their distribution sites. The Hyde Park\\xe2\\x80\\x93Kenwood Food Pantry, a member agency of the Greater Chicago Food Depository, saw a 30 percent increase in the number of households served each Saturday over the last month, according to Margaret Mitchell, the director of the Hyde Park\\xe2\\x80\\x93Kenwood Food Pantry and the Shailer Mathews Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School.</p>\\n<p>Food pantries affiliated with the Hyde Park &amp; Kenwood Interfaith Council (HPKIC) have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseen a surge in visitors since the SNAP suspension began,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d HPKIC caseworker Devonte Appleton, told the <em>Maroon</em>. HPKIC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partners have reported \\xe2\\x80\\x9clonger lines and faster depletion of supplies, particularly in South Side neighborhoods where SNAP reliance is high,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added.</p>\\n<p>The Hyde Park\\xe2\\x80\\x93Kenwood Food Pantry also sought to procure more food supply and recruit more volunteers in response to increasing demand during the shutdown, Mitchell said. The pantry has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgone from 26\\xe2\\x80\\x9328 volunteers to nearly 40\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 on Saturdays to assist with food distribution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServing 150 households in three hours means moving very fast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>SNAP recipients had already been facing disruptions before the shutdown. In July, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/obbb-implementation\">included</a> provisions that restructured SNAP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funding mechanisms and tightened eligibility and work requirements for recipients.</p>\\n<p>Specifically, OBBBA introduced a new state matching requirement for benefits, which have historically been funded entirely by the federal government, forcing states to spend significantly more of their own funds on SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office has <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/Klobuchar-Craig-Letter-SNAP_5-22-25.pdf\">warned</a> that many states will be unable to do so, and 23 governors, including Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, <a href=\"https://governor.nc.gov/june-24-2025-letter-governor-stein-and-governors-across-country-congressional-leadership-proposed/open\">signed</a> a letter to Congressional leadership in June stating that they may be forced to end their SNAP programs.</p>\\n<p>Mitchell explained that the food pantry had been preparing for a long-term increase in demand for several months due to the new work requirements for SNAP recipients and changes to Medicaid <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/obbb-implementation\">codified</a> in the OBBBA.</p>\\n<p>\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are trying very much to maintain our regular food distribution and a sense of calm assurance on Saturdays even with larger crowds, [so] that everyone who comes will receive food,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued.</p>\\n<p>According to Appleton, food insecurity is expected to worsen in South Side neighborhoods even after the end of the federal government shutdown. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHPKIC anticipates increased reliance on charitable food programs and fears that already strained resources may be insufficient to meet sustained demand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.</p>\\n<p>Both Mitchell and Appleton highlighted the impact of the SNAP suspension on newly affected individuals and families, noting that no new SNAP enrollees were approved this month. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose who are newly unemployed, out on disability, or otherwise needing food assistance immediately this month must rely on food pantries,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mitchell said.</p>\\n<p>According to Appleton, a lack of \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutreach to newly affected families who may not have used food pantries before\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Illinois\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response thus far.</p>\\n<p>Mitchell emphasized that while SNAP itself is a supplementary program, food pantries like the Hyde Park\\xe2\\x80\\x93Kenwood Food Pantry \\xe2\\x80\\x9care meant to be supplementary to the supplementary assistance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d <a href=\"https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/news/statement-on-looming-snap-benefit-suspension/\">According</a> to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, SNAP provides the equivalent of about nine meals for every meal provided by the Feeding America network of food banks. Food pantries alone \\xe2\\x80\\x9care in no way able to fill the gap of those nine meals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.</p>\\n<p>HPKIC is advocating for expanded nutritional support to offset federal cutbacks from the OBBBA, Appleton explained. He emphasized the need for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctargeted state support for hyperlocal food programs, including logistical aid and grant access for small nonprofits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>The uncertainty surrounding SNAP funding during the shutdown was itself harmful to families in need, Mitchell argued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dangling uncertainty about whether or not the federal government will ensure SNAP funding is not only about the loss of food, but it is also causing acute suffering and fear for our neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The human cost is great,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mitchell said.</p>\\n<p>Although there has been some state and local action to mitigate the effects\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as an executive order by Pritzker <a href=\"https://www.illinois.gov/government/executive-orders/executive-order.executive-order-2025-08.2025.html\">allocating</a> $20 million to food banks across Illinois\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mitchell said it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis not, and cannot be, a long-term solution.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The federal government needs to make good on its commitment to the SNAP program on behalf of our citizens and neighbors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://chicagomaroon.com/49341/news/south-side-food-pantries-face-demand-surge-amid-changes-and-disruptions-to-snap-funding/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Josh Giddey Is Leading a New Era in Chicago</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://chicagomaroon.com/49336/sports/josh-giddey-is-leading-a-new-era-in-chicago/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://chicagomaroon.com/49336/sports/josh-giddey-is-leading-a-new-era-in-chicago/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[By Klara Bagaric]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:05:35 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Sports]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[basketball]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[chicago bulls]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://chicagomaroon.com/?p=49336</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[After re-signing Josh Giddey this summer, the Bulls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 new identity under Giddey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calm command is here to stay.]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This offseason, the Bulls didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just re-sign Josh Giddey; they doubled down on a new identity. </p>\\n<p>With his re-signing, the 23-year-old Australian guard has been selected to be the face of Chicago\\xe2\\x80\\x99s youth movement and the key star for a franchise long caught in between a rebuild and serious playoff contention. And, if the early results are any indication, that investment is already paying off.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Giddey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Breakout Game</strong> </p>\\n<p>On October 31 at the United Center, Giddey delivered his first true statement performance as a Bull. The fifth-year guard erupted to score a career-high 32 points, shooting 14-for-21 from the field with six assists and seven rebounds, guiding Chicago to a 135\\xe2\\x80\\x93125 win over the Knicks and cementing the Bulls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 undefeated start to be anything but a fluke.  </p>\\n<p>What stood out wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just the statistics; it was Giddey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control. He orchestrated the offense with poise, attacking the paint, reading defenses, and setting up teammates while picking his spots to score. His floater, once overly relied upon, is now a weapon of precision, used sparingly but effectively. </p>\\n<p>At six foot seven, Giddey brings a rare blend of court vision, rebounding, and pacing that has transformed how the Bulls operate. Last season, he averaged 14.6 points, 7.2 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game, showing flashes of a nightly triple-double threat. Now, those flashes are consistently materializing into consistency. </p>\\n<p>Nine games in, the message is clear: the Bulls finally have their conductor. </p>\\n<p><strong>A Re-Signing That Actually Meant Something</strong> </p>\\n<p>When the Bulls officially re-signed Giddey this summer, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just another offseason formality. It was a statement that the franchise was choosing direction over drift. </p>\\n<p>After years of chasing short-term fixes, Chicago is finally embracing patience. The front office is focused on building chemistry, developing its young core, and establishing an identity rooted in balance and belief. </p>\\n<p>Between handling growth and consistent success, Chicago\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goals are still evolving. But, with Giddey as the compass, the franchise\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction finally feels clear. </p>\\n<p>The ball moves, the team trusts, and the pace flows. For once, the Bulls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offense has an identity: organized chaos with purpose. </p>\\n<p><strong>The Payoff of Patience </strong></p>\\n<p>Chicago\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect start isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a fluke; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the product of cohesion. </p>\\n<p>The Bulls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 5\\xe2\\x80\\x930 start showcased a group that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confident and connected. They outlasted the Kings in a high-scoring battle, locked down the Hawks defensively, and battled through tough stretches against the Knicks with maturity rarely seen from such a young team. </p>\\n<p>Veterans like Nikola Vu\\xc4\\x8devi\\xc4\\x87 provide structure, while Patrick Williams and Ayo Dosunmu bring energy and defensive versatility. Meanwhile, Coby White\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offensive balance and rookie Matas Buzelis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s composure and shooting give the Bulls a much-needed boost.  </p>\\n<p>And through it all, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Giddey\\xe2\\x80\\x94the calm in the chaos, dictating the tempo and keeping the team grounded in the momentum.  </p>\\n<p><strong>The Bigger Picture: Progress Over Perfection</strong></p>\\n<p>No one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engraving trophies after nine games, but this Bulls team has found something they have been missing for years: an identity that feels real.  </p>\\n<p>They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no longer scrambling for quick fixes or chasing narratives. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building themselves up, piece by piece, possession by possession, around a core group that is beginning to believe in themselves. </p>\\n<p>Giddey doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be the flashiest player on the floor. He just needs to keep being the steady heartbeat of a young team that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finally learning how to play the long game.  </p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://chicagomaroon.com/49336/sports/josh-giddey-is-leading-a-new-era-in-chicago/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Actions and Aspirations: Court Theatre Introduces New Dramaturgy Cohort</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://chicagomaroon.com/49332/arts/actions-and-aspirations-court-theatre-introduces-new-dramaturgy-cohort/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://chicagomaroon.com/49332/arts/actions-and-aspirations-court-theatre-introduces-new-dramaturgy-cohort/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[By Isabella Coleman]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:56:34 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Arts]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[theater]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://chicagomaroon.com/?p=49332</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[The inaugural dramaturgy cohort is a new project by Court Theatre to facilitate learning and practice in the research-oriented theatrical field.]]></description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the curtains close after a play and the audience cheers, what lingers in their minds? The mesmerizing actors? The elaborate costume designs? The story\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation? Admiration for the dramaturgs? \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDramaturgs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one might ask. Not many would think of dramaturgs or perhaps even know what they are. But without dramaturgy, theater would lack the aforementioned factors that make an audience fall in love with a production.</p>\\n<p>To anyone who is not a devoted thespian, the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdramaturgy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d likely appears quite foreign. Marissa Fenley, Theater and Performance Studies (TAPS) faculty member and a literary fellow at Court Theatre, states that a dramaturg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderstanding the structure of a dramatic work\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and unpacking the kinds of potential meanings embedded within the text.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For fourth-year TAPS student and dramaturg Jo Selmeczy, it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooking for dramaturgical kernels of popcorn that pop when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re activated by other artists.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 That would look like a question that we can ask and any sort of person who encounters it would find something to pop off of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Selmeczy is the student co-facilitator of Court Theatre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new dramaturgy cohort. Led by Fenley, the inaugural cohort provides students with opportunities and experiences with dramaturgy that go beyond just theory. It is an example of the intellectual ties that Court Theatre, an independent, Tony Award\\xe2\\x80\\x93winning theater located on UChicago\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campus, tries to facilitate with the University.</p>\\n<p>Technically, dramaturgy opportunities have existed at the University prior to the cohort\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official founding this year. Fenley says she has been working with Court Theatre for three years, teaching dramaturgy to a few students through independent studies and grants. University Theater, the student theater RSO, has a dramaturgy position for many of its shows, and the Committee on Theater and Performance Studies offers a few courses which touch on the field. Now, the cohort intends to amplify opportunities in dramaturgy in the University, and there are ambitious plans ahead.</p>\\n<p>For the current production being studied, a rendition of Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s The Taming of the Shrew, Fenley and Selmeczy have already conducted dramaturgical research and are now sharing it with the other members of the cohort. For Court Theatre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next production, Miss Julie, Fenley says they will be working with dramaturg Abhi Shrestha, who will be guiding the process for students to conduct research themselves. When asked what the cohort will holistically consist of, Fenley said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this is going to be a space for us to really think and learn about what dramaturgy historically has been and what it could be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>The activities of the cohort differ from meeting to meeting. Sometimes the cohort will meet with guest dramaturgs who will advise aspiring students. Fenley says these dramaturgs visit for only a day and describe their experiences in and approaches to dramaturgy. Other times, the cohort will be involved with rehearsals, such as by observing a rehearsal of The Taming of the Shrew to analyze how dramaturgy is utilized in the production and to interact with performers, directors, and on-set dramaturgs. Mostly, members will engage in regular meetings consisting of dramaturgical readings and collective research.</p>\\n<p>Studying the history and context of a production is not the only reason to do dramaturgy. Along with dramaturgical experience, students will also gain skills that can be used beyond theater. For Fenley, dramaturgy involves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing able to take really high-level concepts and smart thoughts that exist in the abstract and figure out how to bring them into a practical, grounded, applied space that is nevertheless rigorous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Selmeczy found that practicing dramaturgy has personally improved their own attentiveness, work ethic, and self-trust.</p>\\n<p>I witnessed dramaturgy firsthand during a cohort meeting on October 17. Sitting in a circle, the cohort members were captivated by the advice of Tanya Palmer, the production dramaturg for The Taming of the Shrew and assistant dean and executive artistic director in the School of Communication at Northwestern University. Since Palmer usually works with newer productions, she interpreted the classic and controversial Shakespeare play in a modern light. One aspect of her assistance was displayed in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvisual actor packet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that she made with Fenley and Selmeczy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This packet, a kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPinterest of academics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to Fenley, contains multimedia research, ranging from academic article excerpts to TikToks to music videos. Each resource in the packet was connected to an aspect of production, such as a character or theme. Through the packet, the actors improve their understanding of their characters through \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccharismatic anecdote[s]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that ignite associative and adjacent knowledge, as described by Fenley.</p>\\n<p>Theory gave way to practice, and cohort members began taking turns acting out a scene from The Taming of the Shrew. Each new round brought differing interpretations and structures. Text was added and new characters were introduced. The students analyzed the effects and efficacy of these changes, acting like true dramaturgs.</p>\\n<p>While the cohort is still growing in size, this has not restricted Fenley and Selmeczy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aspirations for the group. Fenley hopes that, if this program lasts, future years can involve better incorporation of dramaturgy into productions at Court Theatre. Fenley expects this cohort \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be a way of thinking about what a dramaturgy department at Court might look like and how it could interface with the University of Chicago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Similarly, Selmeczy hopes that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin a perfect world, UChicago becomes a school people go to for dramaturgy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>Typically, dramaturgs are left in the shadows of productions, sometimes not even interacting with directors, designers, and actors. In the words of Selmeczy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause [dramaturgy] is hard to define, it is easily written off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d yet \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceveryone in a production does dramaturgy, they just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fenley and Selmeczy plan to change this underappreciation toward dramaturgs by making the cohort a place to give \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyoung dramaturgs [the] tools to go into a room and advocate, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is the kind of value I bring to the space,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Fenley put it.</p>\\n<p>Fenley and Selmeczy both conveyed that anyone can, and should, join the cohort, no matter their experience or availability. For Fenley, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that the cohort does not have barriers to entry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are first-years in the cohort. There are Ph.D. students in the cohort. There is a huge range. Some people have worked as dramaturgs professionally already. Others have never heard of dramaturgy before. So, I think this is going to be a space for us to really think and learn about what dramaturgy historically has been and what it could be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</p>\\n<p>For Fenley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat it could be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is immediately clear. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing short of taking over the American theater and changing how dramaturgy works,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.</p>\\n]]></content:encoded>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<wfw:commentRss>https://chicagomaroon.com/49332/arts/actions-and-aspirations-court-theatre-introduces-new-dramaturgy-cohort/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\\n\\t\\t\\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item>\\n\\t\\t<title>Homecoming, a UCMed Contract, and Cafes on Campus &#124; Newsletter for November 14, 2025</title>\\n\\t\\t<link>https://chicagomaroon.com/49326/newsletter/homecoming-a-ucmed-contract-and-cafes-on-campus-newsletter-for-november-14-2025/</link>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comments>https://chicagomaroon.com/49326/newsletter/homecoming-a-ucmed-contract-and-cafes-on-campus-newsletter-for-november-14-2025/#respond</comments>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[By Evgenia Anastasakos and Jason Liu]]></dc:creator>\\n\\t\\t<pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:43:26 +0000</pubDate>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<category><![CDATA[Newsletter]]></category>\\n\\t\\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://chicagomaroon.com/?p=49326</guid>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description><![CDATA[Dear reader,\\xc2\\xa0 Happy first snow!

For me, that moment has always been Christmas. Every time I see the first string of lights go up or hear a familiar carol play in the background, I\\'m instantly brought back to this one memory: my brother and I standing beside our Christmas tree, our faces glowing in the soft light, completely mesmerized by the magic of it all.</p><p>Christmas wasn\\'t just a holiday in my family; it was a tradition, a celebration that stitched us together year after year. I grew up surrounded by cousins, aunts and uncles - the kind of big, noisy family that could fill an entire house with love and laughter. My grandmother, the oldest of twelve, was the center of it all. Her home was where Christmas truly came alive. There was always music playing - sometimes Spanish ballads, sometimes classic carols - and the smell of food drifting through every room. The adults chatted and cooked while the kids ran around, counting down the hours until we could open presents.</p><p>It\\'s funny how every memory of my childhood seems to have Christmas tucked somewhere inside it. Maybe it\\'s because Christmas, for us, was never just about the gifts or the decorations. It was about being together, even if that meant the chaos of too many people talking at once or the endless cleanup after dinner. It was about the laughter that made your stomach hurt and the hugs that lasted a second longer than usual.</p><p>My grandma used to say that Christmas was a reminder of <em>esperanza</em> (hope) and that even in difficult years, the season carried a kind of healing magic. I didn\\'t understand what she meant when I was little. Back then, I thought the magic came from Santa Claus or the shiny wrapping paper. But as I\\'ve grown older, I realize she was right. Christmas <em>is</em> hope, the hope that things can get better, that love still exists even in the smallest gestures and that family, no matter how scattered, will always find its way back to one another, even if just in memory.</p><p>If I could go back in time, I\\'d go back to those Christmases. I would go back to sitting beside my cousins on the floor, waiting for my uncle to call our names to open a gift. I would go back to watching my grandma\\'s eyes light up as everyone sang along to the same song she\\'d played for decades. I\\'d go back to those moments when everything felt simple, when love and joy filled the room in a way that made the world outside disappear.</p><p>But time has a way of changing things. Family members move away, traditions fade and the people who once made the holidays special aren\\'t always there anymore. My grandma, the heart of our celebrations, passed down her recipes and her stories, but not even her warmth could stop the years from moving forward. Christmas looks different now. The gatherings are smaller, quieter. Sometimes, it\\'s just my immediate family and me, and though the laughter still comes, there\\'s a small ache that lingers as a reminder of how things used to be.</p><p>Still, I refuse to let go of my Christmas spirit. Every year, I find new ways to keep it alive. I decorate my space, even if it\\'s just a dorm room. I play the same songs that once echoed through my grandma\\'s house. I light a candle that smells like cinnamon and pine, and for a moment, I feel like I\\'m back home again. The world might have changed, but the feeling of that deep sense of warmth and belonging never really leaves.</p><p>It\\'s not about recreating the past; it\\'s about carrying its spirit into the present. It\\'s about kindness, connection and taking the time to make others feel loved, whether that\\'s calling a friend who\\'s spending the holidays alone or sharing a cup of hot cocoa after finals. Christmas reminds me to slow down, to be grateful and to remember that the smallest acts of love can make the biggest difference.</p><p>Maybe that\\'s why, even as life gets busier and the world feels colder, I can\\'t let go of that sense of childhood magic. Because for me, Christmas isn\\'t just a date on the calendar or a season of decorations, it\\'s a feeling that lives in my heart all year long. It\\'s the laughter of my cousins, the voice of my grandma, the glow of the tree reflected in my brother\\'s eyes. It\\'s every moment of hope and love that continues to shape who I am.</p><p>If I could, I would celebrate Christmas again and again, not because I miss the presents, but because I miss the people, the warmth, the memories that made me believe in something bigger than myself. Even though it\\'s not the same anymore, I\\'ll always hold onto that spirit. Because as soon as the air gets colder and the lights begin to twinkle, I can\\'t help but think: it\\'s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, and for a moment, everything feels right again.</p><p><em>Alexandra Garcia Herrera is a freshman from Laurel, Md. majoring in Chemistry.</em> <em>Her column, \"Letter from a Freshman,\" explores her reflections on what happens outside the syllabus: friendships, identity, grief and growth.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/0c157771-e1d0-4b95-8dd9-c39f83650ab6.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Screenshot 2025-11-10 at 1.21.04\\xe2\\x80\\xafPM.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF ALEXANDRA GARCIA HERRERA</p><p>Herrera finds the words for what Christmas means to her: hope.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/0c157771-e1d0-4b95-8dd9-c39f83650ab6.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Monday Mini (11/17/2025)]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[puzzles]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Mini]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[JARED LEE]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/monday-mini-11172025]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/monday-mini-11172025]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<div class=\"embed\"><iframe style=\"height: 90vh; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://crosshare.org/embed/N2qo7oyrEoJR8HXmY7rp/E75Iz6cOVKOx7BQQQkTpiusaVvm1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"clipboard-write *\"></iframe></div>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c5eccdc0-1190-45f2-bd3a-d718dd9b5fea.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Mini Graphic.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c5eccdc0-1190-45f2-bd3a-d718dd9b5fea.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Exploring overdose through a moment in harm reduction]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[science-technology]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[trending]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[feature]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[science]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[BEN ANDREESEN]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:31:28 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/exploring-overdose-through-a-moment-in-harm-reduction]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/exploring-overdose-through-a-moment-in-harm-reduction]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>One Tuesday morning, while standing next to my club\\'s harm reduction card, I watched as an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushed herself forward, nearly passing me on her way to the Johns Hopkins Hospital. She looked up to greet me, then caught one glimpse of our banner which dons clip art images of a syringe, a small pipe with smoke coming out of it and Band-Aids.</p><p>\"Do you have any Narcan?\" she asked, reversing her chair to turn to me with an inquisitive smile.</p><p>\"Sure thing,\" I responded. I opened the cabinet door, revealing a stack of white Narcan boxes. This is one of the most important supplies we distribute; a device that sprays a small dose of <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/naloxone\" target=\"_blank\">naloxone</a> into the nose, preventing terminal overdose episodes by blocking opioid receptors.</p><p>Hop-On Harm Reduction has become a critical site of care for the Middle East neighborhoods of Baltimore. Outside of naloxone, we also provide clean needles and smoking kits, making injection and consumption of drugs safer without guilt and pressure that rehab centers and the general public often propagate. More recently, we have expanded our operation to include wound care supplies, specifically addressing skin-related illnesses that result from the consumption of opioids.</p><p>I handed the lady the box as she rummaged for room in her purse. At the same time, I watched a younger lady hop out of a tow truck, stroll towards the cart and stand next to the first customer. After exchanging a few words of welcome, she too said that she was looking for Narcan.</p><p>\"You never know who you are going to find these days needing this,\" she said</p><p>It\\'s true. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm\" target=\"_blank\">210</a> people lose their life everyday from overdosing in the United States. In 2023, it was up to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm\" target=\"_blank\">300s</a>, according to the National Institute of Health. This same year, overdose episodes killed more residents per capita in Baltimore than any other city, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/baltimore-opioid-epidemic-od-takeaways.html\" target=\"_blank\">170</a> deaths per 100,000 residents.</p><p>I passed the second woman her box of Narcan. She told me that she was grateful for our cart, describing that she often needed to jump out of her truck while riding around the city to administer Narcan. \"I have saved two lives so far,\" she said.</p><p>The woman in the wheelchair, who had finally located a corner of her bag to place her box in, responded.</p><p>\"I just wish someone like you had been there for my brother,\" she said. She turned around to me and furrowed her eyebrows. \"Someone found him lying on the stoop of a house. A stoop! Someone probably walked past, and didn\\'t do <em>anything</em>.\"</p><p>The tow-truck employee walked to the other side of the wheelchair, and said that she also had a brother that lost his life due to an overdose. \"He was on the train. People thought that he was just asleep,\" she said.</p><p>While I was stunned at how non-chalantly these two women described the loss of their brothers to overdose, it is naive to ignore that this is unfortunately common in Baltimore. However, drugs are not the only reason why people who use them die. The apathy, fear, unawareness and misinformation among the general public when it comes to use and addiction means there are very few people who will approach another to save them from overdose. The ladies in front of me surely thought so, orienting their conversation towards one of a more hopeful future.</p><p>\"I don\\'t hesitate. If someone is laying the ground, I stick this up their nose, whether they like it or not!\" said one of them.</p><p>\"God bless you,\" responded the other.</p><p>Many are critical of harm reduction\\'s expanding movement in the United States. Conservative philosophies surrounding addiction often associate death and illness from using drugs as the negative incentive that drug users need to encourage prevention. However, this ignores the context of people\\'s lives which makes using drugs attractive. Just as addiction is a habit forged over long periods of time to help cope with the problems contingent to one\\'s daily life, getting clean takes time too, and oftentimes, it takes many attempts before recovery is reached. In fact, the risk of overdose is <a href=\"http://\" target=\"_blank\">highest</a> right after exiting a treatment. Meanwhile, sharing needles during relapses due to a lack of safe equipment means that there is a continued risk of transmitting diseases such as HIV, which <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61311-2/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">1 in 10</a> suffer from.</p><p>Finally, using Narcan, or other forms of the naloxone compound, has become the most popular method of preventing death during an overdose. It is easy to use for the average person, who, after following <a href=\"https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/recognizing-opioid-overdose/\" target=\"_blank\">steps</a> to identify an overdose, can simply inject the spray into the receiver\\'s nose to stop worsening and fatal symptoms. In Baltimore, over <a href=\"https://health.baltimorecity.gov/naloxone\" target=\"_blank\">18,000 people</a> have been saved as the city government implements programs to distribute Narcan to the public. While clinicians develop novel ways of approaching recovery, harm reduction intends to make ingestion safer for people who use drugs, preventing unnecessary health risks and deaths that have impacted the lives of many Baltimoreans.</p><p>Each armed with their box of Narcan, the two ladies waved goodbye and parted ways. The elderly lady wheeled onward toward the hospital and the young tow truck driver walked back to her vehicle, jumping back into her seat before slamming its door shut. I returned to my seat, glancing at the swarm of birds around the roof vents of the Northeast Market while bass thudded from the speakers of the Caribbean restaurant down the street. While it often feels like our cart is a world apart from the daily life that we see in front of us, many carry the stories of drug-related tragedies, like the past two customers. Harm reduction carts are not only the solutions to ending these stories before they begin, but also fruitful spaces where people can openly share and unload the burden of their past experiences. These two methods create conversations around overdose and illness that inspire hopeful futures for those that most need them.</p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/8edd4f06-ef90-45eb-956e-0310edd2ea6d.sized-1000x1000.JPG\" type=\"image/JPG\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[hopon harm reduction.JPG]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF KARIN TOBIN</p><p>HopOn Harm Reduction seeks to make ingestion safer for people who use drugs, preventing unnecessary health risks and deaths that have impacted the lives of many Baltimoreans.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/8edd4f06-ef90-45eb-956e-0310edd2ea6d.sized-1000x1000.JPG?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[What Mamdani\\'s mayoral win feels like for a disillusioned New Yorker]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[opinion]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[trending]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[MYRA SAEED]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:00:15 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/what-mamdanis-mayoral-win-feels-like-for-a-disillusioned-new-yorker]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/what-mamdanis-mayoral-win-feels-like-for-a-disillusioned-new-yorker]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>A breath of fresh air. It feels like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>I have long avoided publicizing my political opinions and endorsements. I decline answering political questions, maintaining a front of pledged ignorance toward hard-hitting issues to avoid societal judgement or breaking peaceful discourse. Lately, however, my silence toward U.S. politics stems from a growing disillusionment with a system that I know, deep down, does not change from my outcry or frustration. As a left-leaning, Muslim and South Asian immigrant, I have stopped tracking the influx of old white men (often with <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/147-lawmakers-in-44-states-accused-of-sexual-harassment-or-misconduct-since-2017\" target=\"_blank\">sexual assault allegations</a>) claiming they represent me and the average, working-class American, while instead representing the interests of the wealthy elite. Ever since the Democratic party morphed into a faded defensive line against Donald Trump\\'s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93xgyp1zv4o.amp\" target=\"_blank\">absurd unconstitutional practices</a>, I have consistently fled from political spheres in defeat. I walk on the streets of New York City, paying hundreds of dollars for groceries in a two-person household, witnessing the dignity draining from neighbors on the street who <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/nyc-housing-economics-affordability-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\">can\\'t afford their homes</a> and fearing for <a href=\"https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/08/dinapoli-hate-crimes-surged-new-york-over-last-five-years\" target=\"_blank\">racially and ideologically-targeted violence</a>, in complete defeat.</p><p>So when I heard about Zohran Kwame Mamdani\\'s bid to win the NYC mayoral primary, I laughed. I looked into his virtual eyes, heard his bold stance as a Democratic-Socialist and simply laughed at the thought of a Muslim immigrant running the country\\'s biggest financial and cultural powerhouse - in the second Trump era, at that. In fear of growing attached to his charismatic appeal and bold pleas to make the city that I call home more affordable and inclusive of its multiethnic residents, I shook away any possibility of Mamdani winning the primary. Months later, here he is: the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5597788/election-results-zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor\" target=\"_blank\">NYC mayor-elect</a>, and here I am: a New Yorker who finally sees her vision for the city far from the margins of American politics and at the forefront of Mamdani\\'s new, people-centered administration.</p><p>Born in Uganda and raised in NYC, Mamdani has represented the city\\'s diverse heartbeat every step through his campaign. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/internationalbusiness/why-nyc/a-diverse-global-city.page\" target=\"_blank\">37% of New Yorkers were born outside of the U.S.</a>, 49% speak a language other than English at home and nearly half of the city\\'s businesses are owned by immigrants. NYC alone consists of hundreds of neighborhoods, consistently evolving in demographic composition and cultural practices. Whether through <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/05/zohran-mamdani-trying-build-new-nyc-democratic-primary-coalition/405008/\" target=\"_blank\">translating campaign literature and videos</a> in Urdu, Arabic, Bangla, Spanish and more or <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2025/11/mamdani-night-shift-nyc-mayoral-election\" target=\"_blank\">visiting taxi drivers at LaGuardia Airport</a> and immigrant owners in bodegas, Mamdani made it his mission to convince the city\\'s cultural diaspora that he runs as a vessel for them. Departing from the norm of a distanced, elite politician to a man of the people, Mamdani signals a prominent shift in American politics. Even the branding of Mamdani\\'s campaign - \"Zohran for New York City\" - exemplifies his drive to connect with New Yorkers as a human being on a first-name basis, someone who works for them.</p><p>By April of 2025, the average monthly rent across NYC approached $3,966, about <a href=\"https://qns.com/2025/05/average-monthly-rent-nyc-150-more-national-average/\" target=\"_blank\">144% more than the U.S. national average</a> of $1,625. According to Mamdani\\'s platform, <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">25% of all NYC homeowners</a> spend more than half their income on housing: <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/research/may-2025-affordability-benchmark/\" target=\"_blank\">far above the 30% \"affordability\" benchmark</a>. Atrociously, millions of New Yorkers live day to day, barely making ends meet in a city they\\'ve lived in their entire lives. NYC has grown to be an incredibly unlivable city, and politicians have shamefully avoided tackling the affordability crisis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/opinion/zohran-mamdani-coalition-voters.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\" target=\"_blank\">head-on - until now</a>. Mamdani\\'s <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">platform</a> has boldly tackled housing affordability, proposing to build 200,000 new rent-stabilized homes in the next decade, city-owned grocery stores, fare-free buses, free childcare and a rent freeze for the current two million rent-stabilized apartments if he wins. In contrast, current mayor Eric Adams has only raised rents on stabilized apartments by <a href=\"https://www.zohranfornyc.com/platform\" target=\"_blank\">12.6%</a>.</p><p>His campaign even launched an \"<a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/zohran-mamdani-policies-affordability-calculator/6401076/\" target=\"_blank\">affordability calculator</a>,\" showing that a family using his free bus and child-care proposals could save an estimated $45,960 annually under his plan. For once, his campaign does not chirp around issues, instead blatantly committing to the unglamorous yet proper role of government: one that rightfully exists to \"<a href=\"https://time.com/7296925/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayoral-primary/\" target=\"_blank\">lower costs and make lives better</a>.\"</p><p>Perhaps most controversially, Mamdani is one of the few politicians to boldly condemn the Israeli government for its actions in Gaza, including intentionally committing genocide and mass famine, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a>. Mamdani has promised <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/nyregion/mamdani-boycott-israel.html\" target=\"_blank\">to end</a> the New York City-Israel Economic Council, established by current mayor Adams. More impressively, Mamdani has separated anti-Zionism and antisemitism to allow for accountability measures against Israel, while staunchly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/nyregion/mandani-jews-israel-palestine.html\" target=\"_blank\">campaigning against antisemitism</a> and committing to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-jewish-voters-gaza.html\" target=\"_blank\"> protect Jewish New Yorkers</a>. Mamdani easily could have dulled his voice down, morphing his true feelings into the dominant attitudes surrounding him, but he refused to budge. He chose to remain steadfast in his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-israel-palestine.html\" target=\"_blank\">lifelong advocacy</a> for the Palestinian cause. In an age where politicians often mold their beliefs and appeals to the whims of current order at the time, Mamdani\\'s authenticity eases my naturally-inclined distrust of politicians.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, former New York governor and independent nominee Andrew Cuomo has capitalized on the ambivalence of Jewish voters, arguing that Mamdani poses a threat to the city\\'s Jewish community by calling him a \"<a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/cuomo-ignores-nyc-mayors-snake-and-liar-attack-says-mamdani-will-spur-trump-takeover\" target=\"_blank\">terrorist sympathizer</a>\" and proclaiming that \"<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/04/02/cuomos-most-important-issue-00265484\" target=\"_blank\">anti-Zionism is antisemitism</a>.\" In a radio interview, Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/23/andrew-cuomo-suggests-mamdani-would-cheer-future-terror-attack-00620620\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> as a conservative host on WABC said Mamdani would cheer another 9/11-style attack. Cuomo\\'s campaign briefly posted an <a href=\"https://x.com/prem_thakker/status/1981150231174746370\" target=\"_blank\">AI-generated video</a> on social media that depicted Mamdani eating rice with his hands and called him an \"inexperienced radical.\" Beyond Cuomo, the Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa falsely accused Mamdani of supporting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/22/nyregion/nyc-mayor-debate-fact-check/theyve-heard-some-of-the-statements-youve-made-like-in-support-of-global-jihad?smid=url-share\" target=\"_blank\">\"global jihad\"</a> during a televised debate. Adams, after endorsing Cuomo, said the city risked falling into <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/cuomo-mamdani-islam-nyc-mayoral-race\" target=\"_self\">\"Islamic extremism\"</a> as Europe had if Mamdani was elected.</p><p>In this age, political opponents regularly resort to brutal comments when running for a contested position; however, why is it normal to direct race- and religion-based attacks to Mamdani? Why can\\'t a Muslim man run for a political office without being labeled as sympathetic to terrorists? Why can\\'t an Indian man run without derogatory portrayals of eating culture? Beyond himself, Mamdani\\'s bid has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/nyregion/muslim-voters-mamdani.html\" target=\"_blank\">scary for all Muslims in New York</a>, who are well familiar with the rise of Islamophobia resulting from Muslims being brought to the forefront of American politics. Muslims know they will face the brute force of any hatred toward Mamdani. But despite these attacks and despite this attempted defaming, Mamdani persisted in his identity and his message, even visiting over 50 mosques throughout his campaign.</p><p>I grew up in NYC years after the 9/11 attacks; in its brutal shadow, I\\'ve seen it all: from a bus driver kicking me and my mom off early on my way to elementary school for \"security reasons,\" to receiving anonymous text messages telling me \"my people should pay for the twin towers.\" Witnessing a man shamelessly embrace his religion and heritage, while publicly and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mamdani-emotional-speech-decries-islamophobia-new-york-city/story?id=126846079\" target=\"_blank\">tearfully sharing</a> the Muslim experience in NYC, mended a part of me that I didn\\'t realize was broken. For the first time, a political leader has emphasized that Muslims should not have to hide their faith in their own city but rather, they should carry it proudly. Mamdani\\'s courage has made Muslims like me finally open up about the aches that have built up from years of silent societal assault and see a glimpse of a healing light ahead.</p><p>Mamdani\\'s win is nothing short of a perfectly audacious revolutionary paradigm shift. He has rewritten the script on what it means to be a politician and, at that, a South Asian Muslim politician. Without letting fear stop him, Mamdani ran to become a political disruptor. He convinced the city run by Wall Street businessmen and corrupt politicians that it\\'s ready to have a loud, idealistic, unapologetically Democratic-Socialist man lead its people. This beginning of his legacy has energized a new force in American politics: South Asians and young voters. I know when I return home to Mamdani\\'s New York, I don\\'t have to slouch my shoulders in tension with my identity and the surrounding politics.</p><p>So, yes, Mamdani\\'s win feels like a breath of fresh air.</p><p><em>Myra Saeed is a sophomore majoring in Chemistry and History from Queens, N.Y.

People point to how the transfer portal has created a system where players are chasing money instead of remaining loyal to their team. However, they are just looking back nostalgically on a system where the same teams won every year. I think these pundits are completely wrong. This current system is by far the most entertaining college football has been in my lifetime and has fixed a system that exploited young athletes for decades. </p><p>From the fan perspective, the NIL era has created more parity than ever before. In the previous system, you could count on the same handful of teams being competitive every year and in nearly half of the games on any team\\'s schedule you could be sure of a 30+ point blowout. This was because colleges that prioritized football would stack talent. The backups at Alabama would be a top team in the entire country and would have no problem beating the brakes off most teams. However, now that every college has NIL, players are not going to take a pay cut to be a backup at a large program. This creates rosters that are much more balanced talent-wise across the board. Obviously, big programs with large NIL budgets are still going to have an advantage, but there are far more competitive games now than in the past.</p><p>The effects of this can be seen nearly every week of this College Football season. Upsets that would have been impossible before are now regular occurrences. Just a few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401754559/pitt-florida-st\" target=\"_blank\">UPitt beat</a> a ranked Florida State and Northwestern managed to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401752866/northwestern-penn-state\" target=\"_blank\">upset </a>a top pre-season pick Penn State. And it\\'s not just upsets: Competition for the top ranked spots is more open than ever. There is a real chance that Indiana is going to finish as the #1 team in the nation, which a few years ago would have seemed like a fairytale.</p><p>Beyond the fan aspect of college football, these changes have been important for the players themselves. In the past, the players were paid only with scholarships, but everyone was aware that the players did not make any attempt to go to class. Now the players are treated as they should be, as professional athletes. College football programs, especially the premier ones, are bringing in amounts of money that easily rival professional teams. Most big programs (such as Alabama, LSU, Notre Dame) bring in over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6500596/2025/07/21/college-football-program-valuations-rankings-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">$100 million a year</a>. For players to not get any of that money was ridiculous. This new system allows players to be compensated for the work that they put in and the damage they are doing to their bodies and brains.</p><p>When it comes to the 12-team playoff, the main argument against it is that it leads to uncompetitive playoff games, which is a position I vehemently disagree with. Even when there was only a four-team playoff, there were still blowouts often. However, the more important argument for a 12-team playoff is that there needs to be representation from all conferences. The old system often left out undefeated teams from lesser conferences which led to frustration among fan bases whose team never got a shot at winning a national championship despite an undefeated regular season. The new 12-team playoff allows every team that is having a great season a chance to compete for the national championship. It also leaves the door open for Cinderella runs, something that couldn\\'t happen in the old system. It has not happened yet, but there will be a year when a team that nobody expects wins a couple of games in the playoffs.</p><p>It is hard to fight against nostalgia, especially for fan bases that are now losing more games than they did in the pre-NIL era, but these recent changes have been great for college football. NIL and the 12-team playoff have created a more equitable system for the players and a more enjoyable experience for fans that we should all learn to appreciate.</p><p><em>Joseph Rainbolt is a junior majoring in Public Health Studies from Jacksonville, Fla.

I\\'d spent it hunched over my Common App, cranky and sleep-deprived, surrounded by snacks I didn\\'t have time to eat and decorations outside my door I didn\\'t have time to notice. I\\'d promised myself I would celebrate properly next year. I hadn\\'t realized that \"next year\" would mean being hundreds of miles away, with no diyas to light or pooja to dress up for.</p><p>This year, Diwali passed like any other day: one \"Happy Diwali!\" from a friend before my FBBC lecture - then silence. That night, my parents FaceTimed me from home, their faces golden from the light of 21 diyas. \"We did your part for you,\" my mom said cheerfully, angling the camera to show every corner of the altar. I smiled back, but when the call blinked out, the gap between us felt a little wider and darker and my chest a little more hollow.</p><p>The hollowness lingered as I explained Diwali to my roommate. I described the countertops crowded with my mom\\'s cooking, garlands trailing down the staircase and the faint sandalwood scent that clung to our walls for days. I told her about the rangoli we would dance around for weeks to reach the front door and how my brother and I would giggle through the entire pooja. Afterward, I would chase my dad around the house deciding where each diya should go: one by the TV, one on my nightstand, two on my desk so the place I studied would feel extra special. I\\'d fall asleep watching the flames flicker and wake up to find them all gone.</p><p>It\\'s funny how much I craved belonging to an identity that had always been in the background of my life. Coming to college, I\\'d worried I wouldn\\'t be \"Indian enough\" for Hopkins\\'s effortlessly proud, close-knit Desi community. I loved the clothes but never quite knew how to drape my <em>dupatta </em>over my <em>lehenga</em>. <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani </em>with a bowl of ice cream is my comfort movie, but I don\\'t know the new Hindi party songs. I don\\'t even like <em>gujiya </em>that much and pooja had always been a five-minute task before I ran out to catch the bus.</p><p>Yet, waking up to no decorations, no steaming food, no acknowledgement of the day except for a calendar notification reminded me exactly what I was missing. So when a friend made a group chat about hosting our own Diwali party, the jolt of excitement that shot through me made it clear - I wasn\\'t going to miss it.</p><p>The next evening, we took over the McCoy lounge. I changed into a bright green kurta and went downstairs to find a mismatched crowd - some in kurtas and lehengas, others in hoodies and jeans. We scavenged tealight candles from CVS and lined them on a paper plate; someone else brought Lays and a box of laddoo for <em>prasad</em>. There was chocolate ice cream, plastic spoons, Kurkure and Takis. Each new arrival was met with cheers, our group swelling from five to 20 in an hour, the awkwardness dissolving into an easy warmth.</p><p>When it was time for the aarti, I sprinted back to my room for my Bhagwanji figures so our setup could resemble a mandir at home. We took off our shoes and formed a circle, fumbling through the words and gestures, doing as much as memory allowed. Someone pulled up a \"Ganesha Aarti\" video on YouTube, and as the plate passed to me, a girl asked how many circles I usually complete. \"Just until I feel like it, then I give it to my mom,\" I shrugged. She laughed, \"Pretty sure it\\'s supposed to be seven.\" No judgment in her voice - just familiarity that made it all make sense. For a second, it felt like home.</p><p>Then someone connected a Hopkins Bluetooth speaker to Spotify, and our solemnity dissolved into chaos. Soon we were dancing in our socks to Bollywood, our iPhone flashlights replacing diyas we couldn\\'t light. It was a Diwali unlike any I\\'d known - imperfect, improvised, but unmistakably ours.</p><p>Looking around at our impromptu and day-late Diwali celebration, I began to understand how growing up doesn\\'t have to mean leaving home behind. It means learning how to rebuild it wherever you go, translating rituals instead of replacing them. This Diwali was proof that the things I love can survive distance even if they look and sound different here. One day, I\\'ll have my own apartment in some city, my own home to light - or not light - for Diwali. The thought feels both thrilling and terrifying: to know that what survives of tradition will be what I decide to keep alive.</p><p>Returning to my organic chemistry textbook two hours later, my world felt brighter and my life a little more full for the first time in weeks. We hadn\\'t recreated home perfectly, but somewhere between midterms and a Tuesday night GBM, we had all at least tried. We managed to remake belonging from what remained, with whoever showed up.</p><p><em>Vidhi Bansal is a freshman from Upper Saddle River, N.J., studying Neuroscience and Computational Medicine.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/e25084b2-7a64-4ab6-96c6-2fd723b3d1f7.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 12.58.45\\xe2\\x80\\xafPM.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF VIDHI BANSAL</p><p>Bansal on how college has redefined her search for \"the right thing.\"</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/e25084b2-7a64-4ab6-96c6-2fd723b3d1f7.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Democratic spaces: An author talk with Anand Pandian]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[news]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[trending]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[HONORA MURATORI]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Sat, 15 Nov 2025 15:09:30 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/democratic-spaces-an-author-talk-with-anand-pandian]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/democratic-spaces-an-author-talk-with-anand-pandian]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Nov. 4, the Hopkins SNF Agora Institute and Hopkins at Home co-hosted an author talk. The guest author was Anand Pandian, a Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Anthropology at Hopkins, president of the Society for Cultural Anthropology, curator of the Ecological Design Collective and author. His newest book, <em>Something Between Us: The Everyday Walls of American Life and How to Take Them Down</em>, explores the polarization of American politics through the examination of the barriers that exist throughout people\\'s daily lives.</p><p>In an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>, Hopkins at Home explained why they chose Pandian to speak.</p><p>\"The goal of our programming is to spotlight the research and expertise of Hopkins faculty, alumni, and staff in a way that is accessible to all,\" they wrote. \"For this event, we wanted to host Prof. Pandian because the themes in his book [...] resonated with goals of the SNF Agora\\'s new building.\"</p><p>Mary Bruce, the assistant director of public programs at the SNF Agora Institute, began the event by explaining that the SNF Agora\\'s name comes from the gathering place in ancient Athens. The agora was where people had genuine conversations about politics, trade, policies and new ideas. Hopkins\\' Agora is meant to replicate that space and strives to strengthen democracy.</p><p>Pandian started by explaining his journey creating <em>Something Between Us.</em> His research began in the fall of 2016 after the presidential election.</p><p>\"This book grew out of a deep sense of unease,\" Pandian said.</p><p>After President Donald Trump\\'s election, Pandian explained that he felt uneasy as an anthropologist, citizen and parent. He described how he began to question the direction the country was headed and whether the United States would continue to be a place that celebrated its diversity.</p><p>Pandian then read a passage from the introduction of his book. The introduction explained how his experience as the child of immigrants affected his reaction to the election.</p><p>\"My own parents immigrated to the United States from India in 1972, and my siblings and I were born and raised in this country,\" he read. \"We spent a lot of time in India as children, but the United States was home even if there was somewhere in the world where we also belonged.\"</p><p>The introduction went on to explain how that feeling of belonging was challenged by Trump\\'s election in 2016. Pandian was particularly fascinated not just by Trump\\'s promise to build a wall along the American-Mexican border but by the passion and joy it inspired in Americans. He was interested in how this joy existed in relation to the indifference citizens must have felt at the prospect of the suffering that motivates people to immigrate to the United States illegally. Pandian tasked himself with understanding this phenomenon in his writing.</p><p>\"If one wants to make sense of phenomena like border walls, one has to pay attention to the cultural life of everyday walls,\" Pandian realized.</p><p>Pandian explained that in order to better understand the election results, he made an effort to go out and talk to people with whom he wouldn\\'t normally interact. A few weeks after the election results came out, Pandian went to a Trump victory rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Sitting at a bar one day, he overheard a man respond to a news segment announcing another researcher studying the mystery of Trump\\'s election.</p><p>\"There ain\\'t no mystery to Trump voters. Just getting tired of being pushed around and shit on,\" the man said, according to Pandian.</p><p>With that, Pandian began to see the diversity of motivation people had for their political changes. The introduction concluded with Pandian explaining how he challenged himself to exercise sympathy toward people with whom he might deeply disagree. The introduction included the quote that gave Pandian his title, <em>Something Between Us</em>. This quote is from the 1965 debate between James Baldwin and William Buckley and emphasizes the importance of finding connections to people, no matter how much you might disagree with them.</p><p>\"These are my countrymen and I do care about them,\" Baldwin said. \"Even if I didn\\'t, there is something between us.\"</p><p>Pandian explained that getting to know people through his research has allowed him to recognize how surprisingly complicated people are.</p><p>The next chapter from which Pandian read was about patterns of suburbanization in Fargo, North Dakota. Pandian referenced Andrea Vesentini\\'s book <em>Indoor America</em> and his idea that suburbanization involves people purposely withdrawing from the shared spaces of urban communities. Throughout time, space has become less focused on the street and community. Interiors are being created as independent places of escape. Pausing from his reading, Pandian explained how this relates to the conversation about democracy.</p><p>\"The everyday scale of relatedness has a great deal to do with either the vitality or the difficulty of our democratic culture,\" he claimed.</p><p>Pandian then read from a chapter about the life of the American porch. The 20th century saw the presence of porches dwindle as interior living spaces became bigger. This was a result of technological innovations like air conditioning, television and the mass production of houses.</p><p>The development of automobiles also led to a restructuring of roads and shifted the architectural focus of the home from the front porch to the garage. Pandian spoke to property developers who explained that, increasingly, people want houses with their own space isolated from others. Pandian paused his reading to connect his study of porches to the theme of democracy; in a way, American porches were mini agoras.</p><p>Pandian\\'s next chapter was about public spaces. He wrote about Denton, North Texas, a town in which a dominant white majority led to the expulsion of the Black community to the outskirts. There was, and still is, a strong anti-racist movement in Denton. In particular, activists focused on removing a statue of a Confederate soldier erected in 1918 in the center of the town square.</p><p>The Confederate monument gave ownership and power to its white inhabitants. Katina Stone-Butler, a singer and activist, explained that she felt there were spiritual barriers created by the monument. Although everyone had physical access to the neighborhood, white members were supported by their history of power commemorated by the statue.</p><p>\"This place was public, yet segregated,\" Pandian explained. \"Public, yet open only to some. Public and yet welcome to certain members of that public and absolutely not to others.\"</p><p>The monument was finally taken down without warning in June 2020. This was in response to the Black Lives Matter protests of the summer and years of dedicated work by Willie Hudspeth, a Denton activist. Hudspeth held a weekly vigil at the monument for 21 years before it was taken down. Additionally, he testified to the Denton County commissioners court, arguing not that the statue should be taken down but that the two water fountains at the base of the statue should be restored so that anyone could drink from them.</p><p>The last section of Pandian\\'s book that he shared with the audience was from the conclusion. The conclusion referenced the community that came out of COVID-19 pandemic. Pandian wrote about daily walkers, block parties, collaborative parenting and one-way Halloween trick-or-treating routes in Baltimore. Other city initiatives, like the <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2022/01/28/baltimore-community-fridge/\" target=\"_blank\">B-More Community Fridge</a>, shows the way people still value resources that exist in the public space. These examples show that there are still ways for people to take care of each other through shared spaces.</p><p>The talk then moved into a panel discussion. One of the questions Bruce asked Pandian was what his experience talking to people with such diverse opinions was like. Pandian explained that small gestures, like greeting someone on a hike, can help normalize socializing with people you might not otherwise meet. He also explained that it is the role of institutions to make these connections possible; people can\\'t meet each other on walks if their sidewalks aren\\'t well maintained.</p><p>Pandian ended the talk by reminding everyone that thinking about the division of people requires more analysis than individual thought processes. It is about understanding the infrastructure that creates those gaps.</p><p>\"We need to understand polarization not simply as a matter of identity or ideology,\" Pandian explained. \"But instead as a kind of feature of what our lives have become.\"</p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/78821231-062f-4b3d-9e89-b7b0e83d44c4.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Screenshot 2025-11-15 at 3.07.11\\xe2\\x80\\xafPM.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</p><p>In an event co-hosted by Hopkins SNF Agora and Hopkins at Home, Professor of Anthropology Anand Pandian introduced his new book, <em>Something Between Us: The Everyday Walls of American Life and How to Take Them Down</em>.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/78821231-062f-4b3d-9e89-b7b0e83d44c4.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Hopkins students celebrate the University\\'s free tuition announcement]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[news]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[carousel]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[home]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[trending]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[KAYLEE NGUYEN]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:26:40 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/hopkins-students-celebrate-the-universitys-free-tuition-announcement]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/hopkins-students-celebrate-the-universitys-free-tuition-announcement]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>On Nov. 13, the University <a href=\"https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/hopkins-will-offer-free-tuition-to-undergraduates-from-families-earning-up-to-200000\" target=\"_blank\">announced </a>in a schoolwide email that tuition would be free for students whose families make under $200,000 a year. This accounts for approximately 85% of American households. The University is also offering additional aid to cover living expenses and other fees for students whose families earn up to $100,000.</p><p>As the announcement was sent out, students flooded social media with excitement. From reposts to online discussions, students quickly voiced their enthusiasm and celebrated the University\\'s decision.</p><p>One such student, sophomore Reshmita Nayudu expressed her excitement toward the news in an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>.</p><p>\"I think it\\'s amazing, as financial aid is one of the most significant barriers to attending college and also results in a considerable amount of debt post-graduation,\" she wrote. \"This will definitely allow a lot more people to attend Hopkins and will also lessen the financial burden on current students. I\\'m excited to see this implemented.\"</p><p>Similarly, in an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>, junior Ayan Bhatnagar praised the announcement and emphasized its long-term benefits.</p><p>\"I think this is a great implementation! These financial aid policies are what help students from any background to access higher education,\" he wrote.</p><p>Other students highlighted the personal impact the donation will have on their ability to participate in additional opportunities. For many, the announcement marked not only financial relief, but also the opening of doors that had felt out of reach.</p><p>In an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>, junior Brandon Breznik highlighted this impact. He explained that the policy would ease longstanding financial pressures and allow students like him to more fully engage in the academic and extracurricular experiences Hopkins offers.</p><p>\"The implementation of the new financial aid program brought me such immense joy reading it, being able to incorporate the middle-class families who usually floated in a grey zone of financial aid,\" he wrote. \"I know for my family in particular, this is going to help support me in all my endeavors and even allow me to participate in more financially demanding programs like studying abroad.\"</p><p>Other students also emphasized the sense of relief and stability the new policy provides. Junior Luke Chez reflected on the broader significance of the announcement in an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>.</p><p>\"In a time with great confusion and stress surrounding financial aid amongst federal budget cuts and other obstacles, what has been a sore spot for many students has now become a simpler solution as well as a welcome reprieve,\" he wrote. \"As an undergraduate student myself, my hope is that I, among other undergraduates here, will find comfort in the knowledge that we can instead focus on what we students do best. Learn, build, grow. And in doing [so,] we can continue to foster the innovation we do so well at here at Hopkins for years to come.\"</p><p>Across the undergraduate class there was a shared sense of optimism and appreciation for the expanded financial support. Several students noted that the policy represents a broader shift toward accessibility and reflects the University\\'s commitment to easing financial barriers.</p><p>For instance, senior Will Taggart expressed gratitude for the increased accessibility the policy will create for future and current students in an email to <em>The News-Letter</em>.</p><p>\"I think it\\'s great that the [University] is opening up opportunities for people [and not letting their] finances [limit] them,\" he wrote.</p><p>Further, other students echoed similar feelings, emphasizing that even those not personally eligible for the aid recognize its significance for their peers. In an interview with <em>The News-Letter</em>, freshman Dhruva Lahoti noted that the policy signals progress toward making higher education more equitable.</p><p>\"It\\'s a good step forward for Hopkins and making high-level education much more affordable,\" he said. \"It doesn\\'t impact me, but I\\'m very glad for a lot of my friends that it does impact and it makes me happy that they don\\'t have to worry about finances as much as they might have had to before - which is wonderful.\"</p><p><em>Myra Saeed contributed to the reporting of this article.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/ace41702-8607-4396-a10d-4c2916c7421a.sized-1000x1000.JPG\" type=\"image/JPG\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[JLL_6250.JPG]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>JOSHUA LONSTEIN / PHOTO EDITOR</p><p><em>The News-Letter</em> reports on student reactions to the announcement that Hopkins is offering free tuition for all Homewood undergraduates whose families earn up to $200,000.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/ace41702-8607-4396-a10d-4c2916c7421a.sized-1000x1000.JPG?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Bridging human and machine reasoning]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[science-technology]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[science]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[events]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[ALIYAH MERCHANT]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 22:45:55 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/bridging-human-and-machine-reasoning]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/bridging-human-and-machine-reasoning]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Oct. 23, the Whiting School of Engineering\\'s Department of Computer Science hosted<a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/\" target=\"_blank\"> Aaron Roth</a>, a professor of computer and cognitive science in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, to give a talk titled \"Agreement and Alignment for Human-AI Collaboration.\" This talk involves the results of three papers: <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/agreement.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tractable Agreement Protocols </a>(2025 ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing),<a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/collaboration.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Collaborative Prediction: Tractable Information Aggregation via Agreement</a> (ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms) and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.15090v1\" target=\"_blank\">Emergent Alignment from Competition.</a></p><p>With the rise of artificial intelligence in all sectors and fields, researchers attempt to answer the question of how it can help humans make important decisions. Roth uses the example of using AI to assist doctors in diagnosing patients. The process would involve the AI making predictions based on factors such as past diagnosis, blood types or other symptoms. The decision would then be evaluated by the human doctor, who can agree or disagree with the AI\\'s predictions based on their own knowledge, such as patient appearance.</p><p>However, Roth goes on to explain how if a disagreement occurs, the doctor and AI model can then reiterate their opinions for a finite number of rounds, integrating each other\\'s unique view point each time, until eventually, the two will come to an agreement. This agreement occurs because both parties know that the other has knowledge they don\\'t have access to, and can therefore reach equilibrium. This is called a <a href=\"https://sites.bu.edu/blipman/files/2021/10/cpa.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">common prior</a>, meaning both parties begin with the same underlying assumptions about the world, even if they hold different pieces of evidence. With these conditions, the two parties are considered <a href=\"https://fiveable.me/key-terms/game-theory/perfect-bayesian-equilibrium\" target=\"_blank\">perfect Bayesians.</a></p><p>Roth calls this agreement <a href=\"https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/peck.33/Econ601/Econ601L15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Perfect Bayesian Rationality,</a> where both parties have their own set of knowledge. While party A knows what kind of knowledge party B has, it doesn\\'t know the specific details and vice versa. However, this idea has a few drawbacks, for instance, having a common prior in the first place can be difficult. Additionally, as the world itself is complicated, it can be difficult to fully reach agreement. When adding in multi-dimensional topics, such as hospital diagnostic codes, this task can become impossible for humans and AI.</p><p>Roth then goes on to explain how <a href=\"https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/context/ihpbc/article/1166/viewcontent/Contribution3025_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">calibration </a>can be used for these agreements. In order to understand calibration, Roth explains it as a test, for instance, to see if a weather reporter is forecasting correctly.</p><p>\"You can sort of design tests such that they would pass those tests if they were forecasting true probabilities. It is also possible to fail those tests, and calibration is one of those tests.\"</p><p>Roth then introduces conversation calibration, a condition assumed between the doctor and AI. This conditionality means that claims by one of the parties can be based upon what their counterparty made in the prior round. For instance, if the AI claims there is a 40% risk in treatment, and the doctor claims the risk is 35%, then the AI will base its next claim on the doctor\\'s prediction, leading to a risk percentage lower than 40 but higher than 35. This continues until an agreement is made. This calibration allows for faster agreements between the parties.</p><p>So far, this scenario has been assuming both parties have the same end goal, however, this does not have to be the case. If an AI model is developed by a higher company, there may be concerns of other subconscious goals that the doctor isn\\'t aiming for. Roth changes the scenario, where now the AI is developed by a drug company, and while it still aims to prescribe patient treatments, it may have an affinity for prescribing the company\\'s medications. Roth suggests that in this scenario, doctors should consult multiple LLMs. If multiple drug companies each have their own misaligned models, the doctors can consult each one and then choose the best course of action overall. This would cause competition in the market as each LLM provider attempts to make their model the one the doctor will agree with, overall causing all models to become more aligned and less biased, simply due to market competition.</p><p>Roth concludes by discussing the concept of real probabilities - the true, underlying probabilities that describe how the world actually works. While these probabilities are the most accurate and unbiased in real world conditions, it is rare that that specific precision is necessary. Instead, it is often sufficient for probabilities to remain unbiased under a limited set of conditions. In these cases, we can estimate accurate and reliable probabilities directly from data, without requiring the full complexity of perfect reasoning. Through these conditions, doctors and AI could collaborate to form agreements about accurate treatments, diagnoses and more.</p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c724ac1b-4512-444c-8c08-e3092592ffae.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[image.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF AARON ROTH</p><p>On Thursday, October 23rd, Whiting School of Engineering\\'s Department of Computer Science hosted Aaron Roth.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c724ac1b-4512-444c-8c08-e3092592ffae.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Events this weekend (Nov. 14-16)]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[leisure]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[weekly-rundown]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[ADWITA SINHA]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:42:32 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/events-this-weekend-november-14-16]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/events-this-weekend-november-14-16]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Exams may be in full swing, but Baltimore\\'s weekend lineup offers a much-needed break from the grind.

McCall has been working in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated industries for a total of 25 years, with experience in areas including drugs, devices and biologics.</p><p>Throughout his presentation, McCall emphasized the importance of identifying and preventing viral marketing practices that are non-compliant with FDA guidelines. He did so by analyzing a series of case study examples that encompass a wide range of topics, from cosmetics to supplements.</p><p>The first case example McCall introduced was a promotional post the reality star Kim Kardashian made in 2015, which amassed around half a million likes within the span of only a few days. In the post, Kardashian gave a personal testimony of the product that included misleading claims and additional aspects that were not compliant with FDA regulations.</p><p>\"The FDA issued a warning letter for the company, and it required not just the post to come down, but it [also] required Kim Kardashian to do a new post promoting the product within the lines of regulation,\" McCall said. \"This really began the FDA\\'s active surveillance on social media when companies, celebrities or individuals make claims about products.\"</p><p>McCall acknowledged that it is the responsibility of companies to monitor their social media promotions, making sure their products are being advertised in the manner it was approved for under FDA guidelines. However, it is not only social media posts that are subject to FDA law.</p><p>\"Any post anywhere that discusses a regulated product is considered a promotion by the FDA,\" McCall said. \"[This] means that a company is responsible for what they say, not just in their ads or interviews, but their comments. It also means that third parties are held within those regulations.\"</p><p>One case study McCall covered that did not pertain to a social media post involved Jim Bakker, a televangelist. Bakker had made a false claim about his product, named \"Silver Solution,\" stating it has the ability to kill COVID-19 viruses, despite there being no scientific or medical proof to support that claim. According to McCall, the product sales instantly rose as a result of his comment alone, and as a result, many consumers ended up ingesting dangerous amounts of it and suffered various side effects such as turning blue.</p><p>Furthermore, McCall delved into skincare- and beauty-related case studies involving popular brands.</p><p>\"Supergoop! has a product they launched with the claim of an SPF of 50. It was a sunscreen product,\" McCall said. \"When they made this claim, they did so without following the regulations. They did not get approval or clearance from the FDA, and they did not follow the monograph requirements to do this.\"</p><p>Similar to other cases discussed, the FDA issued a warning letter and released a public consumer report regarding the number of severe sunburns and skin reactions resulting from the false claims surrounding the product. However, he highlighted that the presence of viral marketing differentiates this case from other such cases, such as the aforementioned Bakker\\'s \"Silver Solution.\" Although it was certainly creative and trendy, he reiterated that these factors cannot replace compliance.</p><p>\"Viral marketing and FDA law can coexist,\" McCall said. \"Again, creativity and compliance: they don\\'t have to be enemies. The key is integrity. The key is creating content that excites people but doesn\\'t endanger them. And when we pair innovation with compliance, we protect patients and preserve trust and ensure that good companies stay out of bad headlines.\"</p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/344cddd1-4766-4223-a052-358eb471ba79.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[image.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF CATHERINE CHAN</p><p>Dr. Haven McCall gives a presentation about the relationship between viral marketing techniques and FDA regulations.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/344cddd1-4766-4223-a052-358eb471ba79.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Harlem Square in my headphones: soul-twist in the quite corners of August]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[magazine]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[In My Own Symbols]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Memoir of Me]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[BRYCE LEIBERMAN]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:35:08 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/harlem-square-in-my-headphones-soul-twist-in-the-quite-corners-of-august]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/harlem-square-in-my-headphones-soul-twist-in-the-quite-corners-of-august]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>I have never experienced unadulterated joy like my first listen to Sam \"King of Soul\" Cooke\\'s 1963 epic, his album <em>Live at the Harlem Square Club.</em> Hidden beneath a steadily strumming upright bassline and lightly up-tempo drum swing, Cooke\\'s masterful crowd work combines with a raucous, enraptured audience to create one of the most magical 36-minute sets I\\'ve ever heard. It\\'s the kind of music that makes you want to roll your windows down on a quiet summer night, the type of songs that find a way to penetrate a bad mood with a specific kind of impossible-to-ignore, jumping-up-and-down passion.</p><p>In lyrical simplicity, soul music captures the essence of everything that is so keenly <em>right </em>in the world. It transcends chords, strings and vocals to evoke some higher power. Cooke\\'s high-pitched rhythmic scream, heard on the outro to \"Having a Party\" epitomizes the nearly religious atmosphere cultivated by the short but memorable concert. There was extraordinarily little room for interpretation within the four walls of <em>Harlem Square</em>, which is the beauty of it all. Cooke\\'s words ignited a fire in a world that was so clearly rigged against him, one that was eager for him to fail.</p><p>An activist for the Civil Rights Movement, Cooke shared societal and personal struggles through \"Chain Gang\" and \"Bring it on Home to Me.\" His music was a triumphant display of authenticity at a time when racism was a prevalent worldview in America.</p><p>Cooke\\'s sincere craft shines above all; his unfeigned truthfulness to himself is what managed to reach me decades after his performance. As unorthodox as it sounds, soul music has saved me more than once during my time at Hopkins. Arriving on campus in mid-August was supposed to be a flood to the senses - like a moon-landing onto some foreign planet. The impersonal, packed Rec triumphantly showcased double the number of people who attended my high school, and the expectant smiles of people I hadn\\'t yet met left me with a dully sour taste in my mouth. I couldn\\'t quite swallow the fact that Homewood didn\\'t feel like my home, and these people didn\\'t seem quite like the friends I grew up with.</p><p>I walked around my new double room with the silent acknowledgement that I wouldn\\'t go home until Thanksgiving, and that didn\\'t hurt. The weight of distance didn\\'t overwhelm me, and it certainly didn\\'t bring joy; a silent cognizance of my new life was vacancy, not acceptance. That is, until I lay out on my twin XL bed, toes comfortably touching the footboard, put my headphones on and closed my eyes.</p><p>I\\'m immediately transported to a homey, neon-lit nightclub in Miami\\'s Overton neighborhood, with a very much alive Sam Cooke urging me, \"Don\\'t fight it, just feel it.\" He lets the music overtake him, the rush of the ensemble enveloping the crowd in waves. It\\'s almost difficult to see him as the air grows thick with smoke, a grayish haze covering the pit before the gospel-inspired \"Soul Twist\" generates a foot-stomping singalong. For just a moment, I\\'m able to let the doubt and otherness wash over me, and I wallow in the singular aloneness of starting a new life 300 miles from my old one. Cooke grants me unspoken permission to grieve, to <em>allow</em> sadness.</p><p>Enduring pain doesn\\'t have to be a negative experience. I know that I\\'d rather feel lost than feel nothing at all.</p><p>A little over half an hour later, I gently press a button on the side of my head, making a silent but graceful exit with what I\\'d like to think is a knowing nod between a civil rights icon and a white guy from Connecticut. Snapping back into reality through the buzz of the AC unit, my eyes move from the painted white brick slowly toward my in-need-of-a-vacuum floor. Pinpricks on the canvas wall are thumbtack-sized tributes to the singers, movies and people that have shaped those who lived before me. The fluorescent lights of a college dorm room are a brutal contrast to the lowlights of a jazz club, but I\\'ll manage.</p><p>Putting my feet on the carpeted ground again, my next step is not confident but aware. I don\\'t know where they\\'ll take me, but it\\'s hard to be despondent with a voice in my ear singing:</p><p><em>It\\'s alright</em><br><em>It\\'s alright</em><br><em>Believe me when I say it\\'s alright</em></p><p>Long as I know, long as I know that you love me<br>Baby, it\\'s all right</p><p><em>Bryce Leiberman is a freshman studying Political Science and Philosophy from Madison, Conn.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/816621d9-0941-43bb-b96f-04d2af06ea1d.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/heic\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[HEIF Image.heic]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF BRYCE LEIBERMAN</p><p>Leiberman reflects on the importance of Sam Cooke\\'s music on his Hopkins journey.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/816621d9-0941-43bb-b96f-04d2af06ea1d.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Boise, Idaho, watching a giant potato drop]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[magazine]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Memoir of Me]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[My 2026 Bucket List]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[YEKYEONG LEE]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:29:10 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/boise-idaho-watching-a-giant-potato-drop]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/boise-idaho-watching-a-giant-potato-drop]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>I want to spend my New Year\\'s in Boise, Idaho, watching a giant potato drop. At the start of every year, a 17-foot-long spud made of foam and fiberglass - over 17,000 pounds of Idaho pride - makes its way down from the sky in our city\\'s quirky twist on the Times Square Ball Drop. As the countdown begins, my friends and I press closer to the crowd and brave the cold together while the potato starts its descent. After spending my first semester of college more than 2,000 miles from home, I\\'m looking forward to this New Year\\'s potato drop not for the spectacle itself, but for what it represents: a return to where I grew up, to hometown friends and to the familiar feeling of sipping on a pineapple Jarritos from the taco truck down the street.</p><p><em>Yekyeong Lee is a freshman studying Neuroscience from Boise, Idaho.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/03f74125-f169-4b27-9b2b-8503464503f1.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/heic\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Newsletter.heic]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF YEKYEONG LEE</p><p>Lee looks forward to the annual Idaho Potato Drop at the start of 2026.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/03f74125-f169-4b27-9b2b-8503464503f1.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Son of Spergy: Daniel Caesar and the search for acceptance ]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[magazine]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Memoir of Me]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[My 2026 Bucket List]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[THANSI GARIKIPATI]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:27:48 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/son-of-spergy-daniel-caesar-and-the-search-for-acceptance]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/son-of-spergy-daniel-caesar-and-the-search-for-acceptance]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>On most nights, I\\'ll probably be returning from yet another 1 a.m. Brody study session, my headphones in, listening to whatever fits the vibe. Recently, I\\'ve been listening to Daniel Caesar, because he released a new album, <em>Son of Spergy</em>, on Oct. 24. Caesar\\'s been quiet for so long that just seeing his name on a new album feels unreal.</p><p>But I\\'ve heard this album is different. I\\'ve scrolled through Reddit threads: that this one\\'s rawer, stripped down, less polished than his previous work. But I can\\'t help but feel that\\'s the point. Everything here feels a little unpolished: college, friendships, me trying to figure out what a hydroboration reaction is, and I think that\\'s why I\\'m clinging to this release so hard. Caesar turns his insecurities beautiful, like he\\'s scoring the spiral. In his trademark bittersweet voice, he transfigures his deepest flaws and heartbreaks into heartfelt testimony to the mistakes we all make.</p><p>So if <em>Freudian</em> is confession, and <em>CASE STUDY 01</em> is apology, then <em>Son of Spergy</em> will be a form of sacred acceptance: the kind that finds you, between your half-finished essays and undercooked dining hall chicken.</p><p><em>Thansi Garikipati is a freshman studying Biophysics from Edmond, Okla.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c243a272-4875-4e03-ada5-c00cdce42dc1.sized-1000x1000.jpg\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[Screenshot 2025-10-20 at 15.48.19.png]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/69286283@N00\" target=\"_self\">kappuru</a> | <a href=\"https://openverse.org/image/af9e5b55-e87c-463b-b01f-d24fdd28f96e?q=Chungking+Express+%E2%80%93+Wong+Kar+Wai&amp;p=13\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC 2.0</a></p><p>Garikipati describes an album she looks forward to by Daniel Caesar.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/c243a272-4875-4e03-ada5-c00cdce42dc1.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[High and dry in the Mojave Desert\\'s peaks]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[magazine]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Memoir of Me]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[My 2026 Bucket List]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[LEMON DOROSHOW]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:27:00 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/high-and-dry-in-the-mojave-deserts-peaks]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/high-and-dry-in-the-mojave-deserts-peaks]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the summer of 2025, I decided to brave the hundred-degree heat of my hometown near Las Vegas (and its surrounding desert) to return to a hobby that, although dormant for years, has been vastly important over the course of my life: hiking. Among the highlights are the twin Teutonia and Kessler Peaks, situated in the middle of the Mojave National Preserve roughly 70 miles from my home. Although I managed to summit both peaks with a fair share of scrambling, slipping and sightings of the occasional mule deer, I forgot to search for the survey marker - a metal installation in the summit marking government survey records - at the top of Teutonia Peak. These survey markers are a capstone of sorts for hikers and mountain climbers, and it\\'s customary for mountaineers to take a picture with the marker to show that they came, they saw, and they conquered the peak. In 2026, I\\'m excited to make the long drive out from Henderson to the Mojave NP and surmount Teutonia yet again; this time, however, I\\'ll make sure to capture its survey marker in my camera roll.</p><p><em>Lemon Doroshow is a sophomore majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Henderson, Nev.</em></p>]]></description>\\n\\n                                <media:content url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/64e8d0cd-383e-458a-87e0-f9ebca451e18.sized-1000x1000.png\" type=\"image/png\" medium=\"image\" expression=\"full\">\\n        <media:title><![CDATA[High and dry in the Mojave Desert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peaks]]></media:title>\\n        <media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[<p>COURTESY OF LEMON DOROSHOW</p><p>Doroshow looks forward to returning to his hobby of hiking in search of a survey marker.</p>]]></media:description>\\n        <media:thumbnail url=\"https://snworksceo.imgix.net/jhn/64e8d0cd-383e-458a-87e0-f9ebca451e18.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&amp;h=800\" />\\n        <media:credit role=\"photographer\"><![CDATA[LEMON DOROSHOW]]></media:credit>\\n    </media:content>\\n\\n    \\n        </item>\\n    \\n                                                <item>\\n                <title><![CDATA[Awareness of time]]></title>\\n\\n                        <category><![CDATA[magazine]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[Memoir of Me]]></category>\\n            <category><![CDATA[My 2026 Bucket List]]></category>\\n    \\n                        <author><![CDATA[ALEX PAN]]></author>\\n    \\n                <pubDate><![CDATA[Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:26:23 -0500]]></pubDate>\\n\\n                <guid><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/awareness-of-time]]></guid>\\n\\n                <link><![CDATA[https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2025/11/awareness-of-time]]></link>\\n\\n                <description><![CDATA[<p>It\\'s common knowledge that the job of Hopkins students is to complain about every exam and administrative decision ever made. I\\'ve found myself starting to participate in this culture as well. \"<em>Why was the orgo exam harder, even with the increased grade boundary? Why are my portions at Nolan\\'s so much smaller this year?\"</em> These questions have the tendency to burrow themselves into my mind and distract me from my goals. So, the skill I want to develop is not physical, but more of a mindset of gratitude and awareness: the ability to both appreciate and scrutinize my current situation. I want to always start by appreciating how lucky I am to be in the particular time and place I exist in - a university brimming with opportunities, research and innovation - no matter how many stressors are taking up my headspace. Secondly, I want to be aware of the way I spend each moment and have the question of \"Is this <em>really </em>worth it?\" present in my mind. I can absorb endless books and videos about the effective use of time, but none of these ideas will gel if I don\\'t constantly remind myself of them. With this mindset, I will be able to direct my time to my needs instead of being directed by the ticking clock.</p><p><em>Alex Pan is a sophomore majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology from Dallas, Texas.

I want to stop doing things out of obligation or guilt and start making space for what truly aligns with my energy. I\\'m learning that happiness isn\\'t something others can give you - it\\'s something you create for yourself. As Buddha said, \"You are responsible for your own happiness. If you expect others to make you happy, you will always be disappointed.\" Life will always have struggles, but I want to start viewing even challenges as reminders of the light that still exists.

The Drake Passage connects the Pacific, Atlantic and Southern Ocean. The location explains the clips of the 40-foot waves causing fine silverware shattering and passengers constantly holding on for dear life on the railings sailing through what it is coined as the \"Drake Shake,\" making it known as the dangerous waters in the world.
